Neptune's Fountain at the Trsteno Arboretum, founded in 1498 and the oldest arboretum in the world.
According to the World Tourism Organization, with nearly 9.9 million foreign tourists in 2011, Croatia was the 6th Mediterranean tourist destination after France, Spain, Italy, Turkey and Greece.

	Although in terms of the number of tourist arrivals, Croatia cannot compare with major tourism powers such as France, Spain, Italy or Greece, with 11.8 million tourist arrivals in 2012 and a trend of increasing numbers for many years Croatia has certainly become one of the most popular countries on the Mediterranean.
This is also shown by some things that have been happening over the past decade, such as: the “discovery” of Croatia in an increasing number of articles in leading world magazines and other media praising its natural and cultural attractions; the obvious rise in the number of tourist arrivals from a growing number of generating countries; the significant share of tourism in the total GDP of Croatia (14%); the rise in the number of objects of protected tangible and non-tangible cultural heritage; the increase in investment in tourism and auxiliary infrastructure; the increasing variety of what is on offer for tourists, etc.

	Tourism is certainly a most lucrative activity, especially in the coastal regions in the summer.
Here, there is a generally accepted division of all economic activities into “in season” and “out of season” ones.
The summer tourist season, which mainly lasts from the beginning of June to the end of September, is the main stimulus for the development of this, the most attractive area for tourists, where, in 2011, a total of 56 million tourist nights (overnight stays by individual tourists) were recorded (94% of the total number of tourist nights in Croatia).
Of the total number of tourist nights in 2012 (63 million), 92% were by foreign visitors.
Most foreign tourist nights (32%) were spent in the County of Istria, where tourism is most developed in terms of infrastructure.
The other coastal counties follow: Primorje-Gorski Kotar (19%), Split-Dalmatia (17%), Zadar (11%) and Dubrovnik-Neretva, Šibenik-Knin and Lika-Senj (together 17%).
All the others, that is, the continental counties, accounted for 4% of the total number of nights.
Accommodation is distributed according to these figures, mainly along the Adriatic coast.
Since contemporary tourism trends do not favour accommodation in large hotels such as those that were built during the socialist era, there is a move towards more individualism, resulting in the fact that most of the beds today are in private accommodation.
Therefore, most nights were spent in private accommodation (34%) and then in hotels (26%).
For similar reasons, the once very popular workers’ and children’s holiday homes, as special forms of accommodation, have been abandoned or converted.

	Historical overview.
The tradition of organised tourism in Croatia dates back about 150 years, although even before that, at the beginning of the 19th century, some forms of travel, similar to tourism, did exist (such as pilgrimages or trips to spas for cures), so the first inns, hotels and spas were built for that purpose (Daruvarske Toplice, Stubičke Toplice and Varaždinske Toplice).
The period from the second half of the 19th century to the First World War was marked by the construction of road and rail routes and the introduction of steam ship routes on the Adriatic Sea, as a requirement for a serious tourist industry.
At that time, the first hotels were opened, first of all in Opatija (the Villa Angiolina in 1844 and Kvarner in 1884), then in Zagreb, Samobor, Zadar, Crikvenica, Dubrovnik, etc., the first tourist guide books were written (in Poreč and Pula in as early as 1845), while in Zagreb in 1892 trips began to be organised to Velebit and the Adriatic, and the coastal towns (especially in Kvarner) became centres of health tourism.
The first tourist boards were also founded at that time (in Krk in 1866 and on Hvar in 1868).
In the time between the two wars, tourism in Croatia received a boost, receiving an average of one million tourist arrivals a year (in about 1930).
Compulsory tourist taxes were introduced, exchange offices were opened and tourist reviews issued, and domestic and international air routes established.

	It is possible to talk about tourism as a mass phenomenon from about sixty years ago.
After the Second World War, first of all the tourist infrastructure that had been destroyed in the war was restored and nationalised.
At the same time, national parks and nature parks began to be founded, and drama, film and music festivals began (the Dubrovnik Summer Festival, the Split Summer Festival, the Pula Film Festival, etc.).
During the economic expansion of the 1960s, work began on building many tourism facilities: hotels, marinas, campsites and even entire tourist villages, mainly on the Adriatic, but also inland (spas in Hrvatsko Zagorje and Slavonia, and in the national parks in Lika and Gorski Kotar).
A very important year for tourism was 1979, because in this year the first three locations in Croatia were registered in the UNESCO world heritage list (Diocletian’s Palace in Split, Dubrovnik old city, and the Plitvice Lakes national park).
At the beginning of the 1990s, with the transformation and privatisation of tourist companies, the ownership structure changed.
During the Homeland War, due to the danger of the war and the blocking of transport links with the coastal areas, tourism practically died out, and many displaced persons from all parts of Croatia and refugees from neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina were accommodated in tourist facilities.
There was another surge in growth after 1995, and especially after 2000, when a large number of Croatian tourist resorts recorded strong growth in the number of foreign tourists, and Croatia itself was placed at the peak of tourism in the world.

	Trade and guests.
Over the past thirty years the tourism industry has seen three important phases.
In the second half of the 1980s, the number of tourist arrivals continued to increase steadily, exceeding 10 million arrivals.
Then came the time of the Homeland War, during which, understandably, the number of tourist arrivals fell dramatically (in 1995, fewer than 2.5 million tourist arrivals were recorded).
In the post-war period, that number began to rise again, so in the last few years more than 10 million arrivals have been recorded, and 60 million tourist nights.
From 1980 to the present, the proportion of foreign tourists is greater than domestic visitors, and the traditional visitors are from Germany, Slovenia (earlier counted as domestic tourists), Austria, Italy, the Czech Republic and Slovakia (the former Czechoslovakia).
In the past ten years, the number of tourists has increased from France, the Netherlands, Poland, but also from overseas countries.
Apart from the intensive advertising already mentioned, which has certainly led to an increase in interest in Croatia over the past decade, the change in the structure of tourists in terms of country of origin, with the addition of new tourists, is also the result of the introduction of low-budget airlines, and a variety of forms of cheaper accommodation for tourists with lower purchasing power.
On the other hand, with the development of cruises in some destinations, especially Dubrovnik, and the opening of marinas and the extension of their capacities, Croatia is visited by an increasing number of tourists with greater purchasing power every year.
In terms of the way people travel, individual arrangements (64%) still dominate, and only a third arrive as part of an organised package.
On average, tourists stay for 6 days, longer in the summer, and shorter in other seasons.
Dubrovnik - the most famous and most visited tourist destination.
A unique Renaissance city in the Mediterranean with preserved city walls, built from the thirteenth to the seventeenth century, Dubrovnik’s old town was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1979.
Rovinj, recently the most visited town in Istria
Opatija
Opatija, the oldest tourist resort on the Adriatic, is well known for its many villas, the best known of which is the Villa Angiolina, built in 1844.
It was built as a family summer house by patricians from Rijeka, and it quickly became a meeting place for many famous guests and travellers.
The Marina in Biograd na Moru.
In Croatia today there are 61 marinas in operation, and 37 ports, or anchorages, moorings and dry docks, with more than 17,000 moorings in the sea.
Aditional 240 ports are used primarily by local population, but can be used for yachts too.
Although nautical tourism began in Croatia way back in the 19th century, its role did not become more significant until the 1980s, with the foundation of most of today’s marinas and nautical associations.
Zlatni Rat beach in Bol on the Island of Brač.
Traditionally, the most well-developed form of tourism is sun and beach tourism, but lately there has been an increase in diving and sailing tourism, “Robinson Crusoe” tourism in isolated light houses, adventure holidays and cruises.
Of course, those who love other forms of tourism, such as health, cultural, rural, congress, religious, and hunting tourism, can find all they need in Croatia.

The Baška Tablet, one of the earliest preserved written monuments in Croatian, dated about 1100.
This white limestone tablet, which measures 199 x 99.5 x 9 cm, contains the first mention of the word Croatia in Croatian – in the title given to Zvonimir, 'king of the Croats'.

	The Croatian language belongs to the South Slavic group of languages.
It is the official language of the Republic of Croatia, and is also spoken by Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia (Vojvodina), Montenegro (Bay of Kotor), Austria (Burgenland), Italy (Molise), Hungary, Slovakia and Romania, and by Croatian émigrés in Western Europe, North and South America, Australia and New Zealand.
It has three dialects: Štokavian, Kajkavian and Čakavian, named after the interrogative pronouns što?, kaj?
and ča?.
Today’s standard literary language is mostly based on New Štokavian forms of Ijekavian pronunciation and is written using the Roman script.
In the centuries following the migration of the Croats (6th and 7th centuries) Croatian developed primarily under the influence of Latin as the language of Western Christianity, while from the 10th century onwards, the influence of Old Church Slavonic played an important part, as it rapidly assimilated the features of its close relative, the native Croatian language (the Croatian version of Old Slavonic).
In written documents, Croatian started to replace Old Slavonic in the 13th and 14th centuries and by the end of the Middle Ages, had replaced it completely.

	As the Middle Ages turned into the modern age, the language was more and more influenced by Italian, German, Turkish and Hungarian, to some extent, while the influence of Czech was felt in the 19th and 20th centuries.
Up to the 19th century, Croatian was mostly used in the form of written and literary dialects (Štokavian, Kajkavian and Čakavian).
The Štokavian dialect entered Croatian literature at the end of the 15th century, and it was in fact at that time that the early history of modern literary Croatian began.

	In the 16th century, Štokavian spread through a wider area of literary activity, and from the mid 18th century onwards, Štokavian as a literary language became firmly established in the same way as Kajkavian.
Although there were projects in the 17th century to attempt to create a uniform Croatian language based on Štokavian, the duality of the Croatian standardising process was abandoned in the 19th century at the time of the Illyrian Movement.
New Štokavian was used as the skeleton around which, particularly in terms of the lexicon, Čakavian and Kajkavian elements were assembled, and with the introduction of diacritical marks (Ljudevit Gaj), a uniform way of writing the language was adopted.
Thereafter, different schools of language developed (the Rijeka, Zadar, Zagreb and the so-called Vuk schools) which slowed down the natural development of the language, more or less separating it from Croatian written tradition.

	During the time of the Yugoslav state (1918-1941 and 1945-1991), the development of standard Croatian was again hindered, and in 1954 the Novi Sad Agreement was reached, according to which Croats, Serbs and Montenegrins (at the time, Bosniacs were not acknowledged) agreed to introduce a compulsory common name for the language (Croato-Serbian, or Serbo-Croatian), produce a common orthography and lexicon, and standardise general scientific terminology.
The Declaration on the Name and Position of the Croatian Literary Language (1967) sparked open opposition from the Croatian public to this language policy, so that in spite of the pressures to which Croatian was exposed, the process of making uniform standard forms of the two languages was never actually carried out.
Although speakers of either language can understand each other, Croatian has developed in significantly different cultural and historical circumstances and today forms a quite separate South Slavic language, in the linguistic and particularly in the sociolinguistic sense.

The Pula Film Festival, held every summer in the Pula Arena, was launched in 1954 and is one of the oldest film festivals in the world.

	The history of professional Croatian cinematography began only in the mid 20th century, although the first preserved films of Croatian places were made as early as 1898 by Alexandra Promio of the famous film company Lumière, and in 1904 by Frank Sheffield, the English film pioneer.
Between the two World Wars, several Croatian actors enjoyed notable careers in other European countries (Zvonimir Rogoz).
The documentary and short films of internationally acclaimed Oktavijan Miletić and the educational films produced by the School of National Health, which thanks to mobile cinematography were watched by audiences throughout Yugoslavia, are of historical significance.
State-sponsored film production was launched during the time of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), when propaganda documentary and cultural films were made, and in 1944, the first full-length feature film with sound, Lisinski, was made, directed by Miletić.

	The post-war Communist regime supported film production, introduced film studios, and up to the early 1950s produced many documentaries and films with war themes (known as Partisan films).
In the mid 1950s, films were made on a level with Soviet and Hollywood films, while stylistic features typical of European films were evident, particularly traces of neorealism, but also modern narrations (Koncert, by Branko Belan; H-8…, by Nikola Tanhofer), and classical genres were also mastered (Ne okreći se sine, by Branko Bauer).
Croatian film then achieved its greatest success; the war melodrama The Ninth Circle was nominated for an Oscar in the foreign film category, and this was followed by similar successes by Yugoslav co-productions of Partisan spectacles, in which Croatian directors, cameramen, actors and studios participated (Battle on the Neretva, by Veljko Bulajić).
In this period, Croatian cinematography, along with excellent documentaries and children’s films, included internationally acclaimed experimental films (Mihovil Pansini, Tom Gotovac, Ivan Martinac, Sanja Iveković, Dalibor Martinis).
The greatest contribution to world film was made by the Zagreb School of Animated Film, with a series of original, modernist, un-Disneylike cartoons by authors such as Dušan Vukotić, Vladimir Kristl, Vatroslav Mimica, Aleksandar Marks, Vladimir Jutriša, Boris Kolar, Zlatko Bourek, Nedeljko Dragić, Zlatko Grgić, Zdenko Gašparović and Borivoj Dovniković, and the popular series Professor Baltazar.
During the 1960s and 1970s, Croatian film-making was characterised by originality, part of the Eastern European ‘new film’ trend, i.e.
modernism (the works of Vatroslav Mimica, Ante Babaja, Antun Vrdoljak, Krsto Papić, Tomislav Radić, Zvonimir Berković, Krešo Golik, Fadil Hadžić, Lordan Zafranović and Rajko Grlić).
During the 1980s, genre-based films dominated in the postmodern spirit (the works of Zoran Tadić), while in the early 1990s, cinematography went through an organisational and production crisis.
However, a new generation of directors soon arose (Zrinko Ogresta, Lukas Nola, Vinko Brešan, Hrvoje Hribar, Dalibor Matanić, Ognjen Sviličić and Arsen Anton Ostojić), who contributed to the revival of cinematography.
Since 2000, multi-screen cinemas have spread throughout most large towns.
Production has been reanimated in particular through the reform of the public film subsidies system in 2008 and the creation of the Croatian Audiovisual Centre, the main governing body for the audiovisual sector, increased international co-operation through the membership in the European co-production film fund Eurimages, as well as the participation in the MEDIA Programme of the European Union.
Branko Lustig, the eminent Croatian producer, who has worked in Hollywood since the late 1980s, co-produced two films which won Oscars (Schindler’s List and Gladiator)

	Traditional Croatian culture is characterised by exceptional diversity.
Ecological conditions and the influences of the cultures with which the Croats have come into contact through history (Mediterranean, Central European, Ancient Balkan, Oriental, etc.
), have resulted in the development of three specific regional cultures: Pannonian, Dinaric and Adriatic.
The Pannonian cultural zone has been characterised by the growing of grain, flax and hemp, and breeding larger domestic animals (horses, cattle).
The people lived in single-storey houses made of wood or mud and wattle (in the west), or of compacted clay or unfired bricks (in the east), with straw roofs.
Along the River Kupa and River Sava, two-storey houses were prevalent, the successors to pile-dwellings.
Furniture was tall.
Home crafts which were particularly developed included weaving on a horizontal loom and pottery using a foot-turned wheel.
One particularly interesting form of artistic expression was the decoration of gourds.
Clothes were made from densely smocked cloth with richly woven or embroidered decoration, and topped off with broadcloth or leather jerkins, wide broadcloth capes or sheepskin coats and broad soft-soled shoes (kapičari), or boots.
Women wore necklaces made of coral or glass beads and, in Slavonia, of gold coins.

	Annual processions of young people through the village on feast days, collecting gifts, were common (jurjaši on St. George’s Day, kraljice or ljelje at Pentecost, ladarice on Midsummer’s Day, betlehemari on Christmas Eve, etc.
), as were lavish wedding customs.
Music and dance traditions also varied greatly.
In Međimurje, there was a specific form of unison singing based on medieval scales (known as the Old Church style), and the instruments played were the bordun zither, cimbalom and violin, to which couples would dance (the influence of the Alpine zone).
The most famous dance in northwest and central Croatia was the drmeš, danced in pairs or small reels to the music of a string ensemble known as guci.
Reel dancing was characteristic in Slavonia and Baranja, accompanied by bagpipes (gajde), folk instruments made from animal skins, which by the 20th century had been virtually replaced by the tambura (a stringed instrument something like a mandolin).

	In the Dinaric cultural zone (highland Croatia and the Dalmatian hinterland), sheep and goat breeding was dominant.
Shepherds spent the summers in the mountains with large flocks of sheep, and in winter, moved them to the coastal areas, using mobile pens and huts.
In Alpine regions, families would move their flocks in spring from the villages in the valley to high dwellings, where they worked in the meadows and hayfields, then in the summer months to the mountain pastures.
In the autumn, they would gather the meadow produce and return to the villages before winter set in.
In highland Croatia, houses were mostly made of wood, often with a stone ground floor section, and the tall, steep roofs were covered in wooden slats.
Furniture was low.

	Lace, a netted, ornamental handicraft made from various fibres, used primarily to decorate clothes, and later as an ornament in itself.
In Croatia, needle-lace is produce on the island of Pag, bobbin-lace in Lepoglava in Croatian Zagorje, and aloe lace on the island of Hvar.
All have been inscribed in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List.
Home crafts included spinning and weaving woollen fabrics for soft furnishings and clothes, producing rolled broadcloth in mills powered by water, and pottery using a hand-turned wheel.
Shepherds were particularly skilled in woodcarving.
Women’s costumes consisted of cloth blouses, simply cut, with characteristic geometric embroidery on the breast and edges of the sleeves, woollen pinafores and long, broadcloth jackets known as zobun.
Men wore narrow broadcloth trousers and jackets in three layers over a shirt, a wide leather belt and several layers of woollen socks decorated with scraps of broadcloth.
Girls and men wore low, red, broadcloth caps, while married women covered their heads with white kerchiefs.
Light, woven soft-soled shoes were worn on the feet.
Clothes for special occasions were set off by large amounts of silver jewellery and men often carried engraved weapons.
Social life included specific forms of non-blood kinship (fraternities, godparents, etc.
).

	The musical tradition was characterised by a specific type of singing, ojkanje, which emerged as a refrain in various types of short song (rozgalice, gange, etc.).
Longer narrative songs describing heroic deeds were performed by guslari, who accompanied their own singing on gusle, single-stringed instruments played with a bow.
The typical dance was the nijemo kolo (Silent Reel – also called the Vrlika, Lika or Sinj Reel), which was performed in large steps and leaps with no musical accompaniment.
In the Adriatic cultural zone, the population was engaged in fishing and cultivating olives, vines, figs and almonds and rearing sheep and goats.
They grew vegetables and, to a lesser extent, grains on small terraced meadows.
They also used wild plants such as broom (for yarn) and carob.
Shipping and trade were also important.
Their houses were made of stone, usually tall, narrow buildings roofed with cylindrical tiles or split limestone slates.
They had open hearths equipped with range-hoods and typically Mediterranean utensils (gridirons, chains, bellows).

	Their costumes developed from their urban milieus.
Men’s costumes were characterised by typical Mediterranean components such as wide trousers, gathered at the waist, short stockings and cylindrical woollen caps.
Women’s costumes comprised cloth blouses over which bell-shaped broadcloth skirts with shoulder straps were worn, encircled by woollen or silk belts.
They preferred jewellery made of precious metals, complemented with coral or pearls, often in the form of filigree work.
At Christmas and the New Year, it was customary to process through the streets, greeting the neighbours with songs and collecting gifts (koledanje), and Carnival customs were widespread.
Klapa singing is considered to be a particular characteristic of Dalmatian folk music – multi-part singing in small groups, klape, with no musical accompaniment.
Rural dances (the linđo and poskočica) were accompanied by lijerica, three-stringed bowed instruments, while in the towns, dances such as the šotić and kvadrilja were accompanied by guitars or mandolins.
The traditional music of Istria and the Croatian Primorje were characterised by chromatic scales (the best known is the Istrian Scale), upon which songs and music played on sopele, or roženice (woodwind instruments with piercing tones) were based.
Often two such instruments were played, one large and one small, producing two-toned close intervals or unison sounds, and ending in octaves.
The same two-toned effect was mirrored in singing performed by several singers.
The balun and tanac were danced to the accompaniment of the sopela.

In the early 20th century, 80% of the population of Croatia was rural, and to a great extent continued to live along traditional patterns.
Although traditional culture began to disappear in the late 19th century, affected by modernisation and urbanisation, this process accelerated in the mid 20th century.
Many elements of traditional culture today continue in changed forms and new contexts, and have gained new significance, while some have come to denote national, regional or local identity.

	These include, for example, the Carnival procession of the bellmen (zvončari) in the Kastav area, performances of a military dance with swords (moreška) in the town of Korčula, the custom called kumpanija in the villages of Korčula, the annual Pentecost procession of the kraljice, or ljelje in Slavonia and Srijem, the knights’ tournament known as the Sinjska Alka, and many others.
Traditional music, songs and dances are most often performed at folklore festivals or during various ceremonial events, when the performers usually dress in folk costumes.
The best known such even is the Zagreb International Folklore Festival, then there is the Vinkovci Autumn Festival, the Đakovački Vezovi (also folklore festivals), the Dalmatian Klapa Festival in Omiš, and others.
Along with many amateur folklore societies, the professional Lado Ensemble (founded in 1949) is particularly dedicated to nurturing the Croatian folk tradition and performs folk dances and songs.

Performance by the Lado Ensemble
Kornati National Park (1980), south of Šibenik and Zadar, encompasses an archipelago of about one hundred islands and islets.
Enchanted by the beauty of its landscape, the Nobel laureate George Bernard Shaw wrote: 'On the last day of the Creation, God desired to crown His work and thus created Kornati Islands out of tears, stars and breath'.

	The Adriatic Sea is the most indented section of the Mediterranean Sea on the continent of Europe.
In its present shape, it was formed by the rising of the sea level by 96 metres following the last ice age in the Pleistocene period, when valleys and basins were submerged, and the dry land emerged as elongated islands, separated by sea channels.
The Croatian Adriatic coastline is 1,777 km long and occupies most of the eastern Adriatic shoreline.
It is only 526 km from the most northerly to the most southerly point as the crow flies, but due to many bays and coves, it is among the three most indented shorelines in Europe.
The elongated islands extend parallel to the shore, separated by channels, and counting the island shorelines as well, the total is 5,835 km, which is almost three-quarters of the total Adriatic shoreline.
In terms of its length, the Croatian shoreline is the third longest in Mediterranean, after Greece and Italy.
Due to its indentation and geological structural characteristics, this type of shoreline is known in expert literature as Dalmatian.

	The clarity of the seawater rises from around 20 metres in the north to a maximum of 56 metres in the south, and is greater in the open sea than by the shore.
The seawater reflects different shades of blue, depending on position.
In general, the Adriatic Sea along the Croatian coastline is characterised by a particular clarity and intense colour, which contributes to the uniqueness of the landscape, along with the picturesque shoreline.
There are fishing grounds (white and oily fish) offshore and off the outer islands, while the water is rich in different types of crustaceans.
Red coral can be found in habitats at greater depths.

	The natural beauty and picturesqueness of the Croatian coastline is accentuated by the mild Mediterranean climate, with between 2,400 and 2,800 hours of sunshine per year, which makes it one of the sunniest coastlines in Europe.
There are 718 islands and islets, 289 rocks and 78 reefs along the coastline, so Croatia may justly be called the ‘land of a thousand islands’.
Although the islands amount to only 5.8% of the total surface area of the country, their importance for the geographical identity of the country is much greater.
Most are limestone, like the coast.
The exceptions are the outer islands of Jabuka and Brusnik, which are volcanic in origin, and the sandy island of Susak.
About fifty islands are inhabited (most have several settlements), and according to the population census of 2011, 132,443 people live on them.
Although island life is traditional linked to the sea (fishing, sailing, boatbuilding), each inhabited island is a miniature cosmos in itself.

	Its position on the long, indented Adriatic coast, with its unique archipelago, has enabled Croatia to engage in maritime travel and trade since ancient times.
Among the Slavic countries, Croatia is the only one whose maritime and Mediterranean orientation has become deeply rooted in the traditions and daily lives of its people.
In accordance with the UN Convention on Law of the Sea, Croatia holds sovereignty of the part of the Adriatic Sea which belongs to its coastline, internal sea waters and territorial waters (about 31,000 km²), and in 2003, declared an Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone, which covers a further 23,870 km².

In 1990 Croatia was, with Slovenia and the Czech Republic, among the most developed Central European transition countries.
However, its economic development was burdened by significant war damage, estimated at $37.1 billion, which made its transition to a market economy more difficult.
The level of pre-war GDP (1990) was only reached again in 2004, and today’s GDP per capita amounts to 61% of the EU average (2012).
The kuna, the national currency, was introduced in 1994.

	The Croatian economy is one of the strongest in Southeast Europe, and in terms of its GDP is even stronger that the economies of some members of the European Union.
After the collapse of the socialist system, it underwent transition to an open market economy, which especially related to industrial production.
During the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the economy of the area of Croatia was mainly agricultural, although that period was marked by the beginning of the industrial age.
Domestic capital was limited, so Austrian and Hungarian capital dominated, and production mainly made use of natural resources (forests) and agricultural products.
With the simultaneous development of transport, primarily the railways, the development of the first significant industrial centres became possible (Rijeka, Zagreb, Osijek, Karlovac and Sisak).
The conditions for the development of industry became more favourable after Croatia became part of the state of Yugoslavia, within which Croatia, alongside Slovenia, was the most developed region, with a wider market, protected by customs duties.

	After the Second World War, under the socialist economy, there was rapid industrialisation and the development of the economically backward, previously agricultural areas.
The Yugoslav self-management socialist system was specific, different and more dynamic than the centralised, planned economies of the other Eastern European states.
Property, which became state-owned through nationalisation, was transferred into social ownership according to that model.
The main management body in enterprises was the workers’ council, through which the workers decided, at least formally, on production and distribution.
The highest growth rate was recorded from 1953 to 1963, when the Yugoslav, and so also the Croatian, economy was one of the most dynamic in Europe.
But already in the 1970s, growth began to slow and in the 1980s the economy showed signs of crisis, which was seen primarily in high inflation.
Croatia, however, along with Slovenia, was still the most economically developed republic in Yugoslavia, especially in the areas of agriculture, industrial production, construction, the oil industry, ship building and tourism.

	After the break-up of Yugoslavia, the Croatian socialist and semi-market economy was transformed into a system based on private ownership and an open market economy.
This transition, however, was delayed and hindered by the aggressive war against Croatia and the adjustment of economic policies to the needs of defence.
Economic development was burdened by a large amount of war damage, estimated in 1999 to amount to USD 37.1 billion, which also made transformation and privatisation more difficult.
In addition, the transformation process by which the former public (social) ownership became state owned and then privately owned, was undertaken in agreement between the political and business elite, frequently without the actual purchase of enterprises or investment in them.
The transition therefore had many negative social and economic effects: the impoverishment of the population, a rise in corruption and economic crime, and the devastation of industry.

	The Croatian dinar was introduced as a temporary currency at the end of December 1991, and the Croatian kuna was launched as the new national currency in 1994.
From October 1993, Croatia began to conclude stand-by agreements with the International Monetary Fund and from 1994 it received its first loan from the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which eased the economic situation, but led to the country’s growing debt.
After the immediate difficulties of the war had been overcome, Croatia moved into a phase of increasing Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
The highest growth rate of 5.2% was recorded in 2002, and in 2003 GDP reached its level before the war (USD 24.8 billion, 1990).
The rising trend of GDP continued until 2008, when a fall and then stagnation occurred, caused primarily by the worldwide recession.
At the end of the 1990s, the largest proportion of GDP was accounted for by the service sector (59%) followed by industry (32%) and agriculture (9%), which was similar to most developed countries.
Over the last couple of years, due to the cycles of recession in the global economy, there have been negative trends in all branches of the economy, except in tourism.
In 2011, of the total number of employed, 55.6% were employed in privately owned enterprises, 37.1% in state owned companies, 7% in mixed companies and 0.3% in cooperatives.
The largest number of workers is employed in manufacturing industry, agriculture, forestry and fishing, trade, health care and tourism.
The Agriculture and Forestry Exhibition held in 1891 in Zagreb, a significant exhibition of the Croatian economy at the end of the 19th century.

It reaches 100 km/h in 2.8 seconds and tops 300 km/h.

	Croatia is considered the home of many inventions which have transformed human existence, several of which are used in everyday life.
1617: the parachute.
The polymath, inventor, philosopher and lexicographer Faust Vrančić (1551–1617) was the first person to stretch fabric over a wooden frame to make a parachute, with which he made a jump in Venice in 1617.
He described it in detail, along with 56 more inventions, in his work New Machines, and called the parachute Homo volans (Flying Man).
He published a Dictionary of the Five Most Reputed European Languages in 1595, the first dictionary printed in Croatia.
1861: the torpedo.
The naval officer and inventor Ivan Blaž Lupis (1813–75) built a prototype of an explosive weapon which could be used to attack enemy ships in 1861.
After signing a contract with Lupis, a factory in Rijeka developed his invention and was the first in the world to begin mass production of torpedoes which were completely like those used today.
The technical solutions of the Rijeka torpedo are used today for peaceful purposes.

	1887: ‘supersonic’ photography.
Peter Salcher (1848–1928) was a professor of mathematics at the Naval Academy in Rijeka.
He was the first person in the world to produce ultrafast photography, used to track the trajectory of a rifle bullet in flight.
1891: dactyloscopy.
Ivan Vučetić (1858–1925) was a criminalist who emigrated to Argentina in 1884, where he was employed in the police force.
He was one of the founders of dactyloscopy and invented a system for classifying fingerprints which he applied in solving criminal cases.

	1904: the tungsten light bulb.
The chemist and metallurgist Franjo Hanaman (1878–1941) developed a process for manufacturing tungsten filaments and their application in electric light bulbs, with Alexander Just, in Vienna.

	1906: the ballpoint pen.
The Croatian inventor Slavoljub Penkala, of Polish origin (1871–1922), patented many inventions which are still used today.
The most famous was his ballpoint pen, which the Penkala factory sold in around 70 countries.
He also invented the thermos flask, the rotating toothbrush, and many more devices.
He built the first aeroplane in Croatia in 1910 and is considered the father of modern aircraft.
1954: the Puratić power block.
Mario Puratić (1904–93) emigrated to the USA in 1929, where he invented a power block to help haul fishing nets out of the sea and on board vessels.
His invention has been applied in all the world’s fishing fleets.
1981: the antibiotic azithromycin.
A group of scientists from the research institute of the Pliva pharmaceutical company synthesised and patented azithromycin, a new type of wide-spectrum antibiotic which could stay in the body for long periods.
Its active ingredient in Croatia is marketed as Zithromax and Sumamed.

A truffle, a fungus that grows underground.
They are highly prized as a delicacy and are extremely expensive.
Truffle-hunting and cooking have developed in Istria.
It was in this region that the world's largest truffle, weighing 1.310 kg, was discovered.

	The main feature of Croatian cuisine is its diversity, so it is impossible to single out a typical cuisine or typical dish.
Different natural and economic circumstances and diverse cultural influences have affected the development of several regional cuisines.
Four main areas can be identified, but each of these has several subgroups with their own specific characteristics and specialities.
The Adriatic coast belongs to the Mediterranean world of cuisine.
The food is light and includes a lot of fish and other seafood – cuttlefish, squid, octopus and shellfish.
These are stewed, casseroled, grilled or roasted.
Plenty of vegetables, legumes and wild plants (wild asparagus, meadow plants – mišanca) are also eaten.
They are made into soups (maneštra), or steamed or boiled and seasoned with olive oil and garlic.
Olive oil is the basic culinary addition.
The most frequently prepared meats are mutton, and to a lesser extent, beef.
A favourite beef dish is pašticada, braised with herbs, prunes and dried figs, bacon and red wine, and the most common accompaniments are potato noodles (gnocchi).
Pork is smoked and air-dried to produce proscuitto and pancetta.
The most famous hard cheese is goat’s cheese from the island of Pag.

	The cuisine of Lika and Gorski Kotar is most meat-based: lamb, kid, beef and some pork.
Meat is cooked with beans and pickled cabbage or turnip, grilled or roasted, and may be smoke-dried.
The most common accompaniments are potatoes (ličke pole).
Game is also eaten, particularly venison or boar goulash.
Various kinds of mushrooms grow plentifully in the woods.
The diet of these predominantly cattle-farming areas also includes plenty of dairy produce, such as the famous Lika cheese, škripavac.

	Dairy products are also part of the cuisine of northern and central Croatia.
Soft cow’s cheese, eaten with sour cream, is popular, as is podravska prga, a dried cheese seasoned with paprika and garlic.
Sour cream is often added to stews and soups.
Meat is usually poultry or pork.
Turkey with mlinci, a side-dish of unleavened pastry, is one of the most famous dishes in Croatian Zagorje and the Zagreb area.
Štrukli, filled pastry turnovers, are another popular dish.
They can be sweet or savoury, boiled or baked, added to soup, filled with soft cheese, apples, pumpkin, poppy seeds, millet, etc.
Dishes made from buckwheat, millet and barley used to be common, but these ingredients are less frequent on modern menus.

	The culinary tradition of northeast Croatia (Slavonia and Baranja) relies heavily on pork, whether fresh or processed as dried products – sausages, bacon, ham, pork crackling, or the famous kulen and kulenova seka (types of salami).
Čobanac is a goulash made with several kinds of meat, served with potatoes or dumplings.
River fish are used to make paprikaš.
Dishes are seasoned generously with paprika.
Lard is used to make lard cakes (salenjaci).

	Fine food and drink are an integral part of the traditions of the Croatian regions and an important factor in their contemporary identities.
One component is the range of different gourmet treats for tourists – truffles in Istria, chestnuts in Kvarner, the ‘What our Ancestors Ate’ festival in Vrbovec – and restaurants and rural farms which offer traditionally prepared dishes, or those based on tradition, but adapted to modern culinary principles.

Ban Josip Jelačić Square in Zagreb, capital of Croatia.
Zagreb, which has about 700,000 inhabitants, is home to one in six inhabitants of Croatia.

	Croatia has been present on the contemporary international political stage since its independence from the Yugoslav Federation, i.e.
for a little over two decades,   but in terms of history and culture, it is one of the oldest European countries.
The present-day territory of Croatia and its borders were formed over a long period of history, during which the Croatian nation, whether independent or incorporated within other states, constantly displayed its own subjectivity in national and political terms.
The geopolitical situation of Croatia is determined, therefore, by the convergence and influence of different ethnic, religious, economic and political factors.
With respect to the complex position of the country, Croatian authors usually define it as Central European and Mediterranean.

	According to the predominant historical orientation of most of the present-day territory, which gravitated towards Vienna and Budapest, and according to the geographical characteristics of its continental interior, Croatia is a Central European country.
On the other hand, its exceptionally long sea front which, with the immediate inland region, fell under the historical influence of the powers of Venice, make it a Mediterranean country.
In the hinterland of the Adriatic coast, in a triangle formed by the towns of Nin, Knin and Šibenik, the seeds of the first medieval Croatian state were sown.
The general shift of economic centres of gravity to the north in Europe, and Croatia’s entry into a state connection with Hungary, moved the centre of gravity of the Croatian state towards Zagreb.
In the wider context of the Croatian region, several powerful political, economic and civilisational centres developed through the ages (the Ancient Greeks, the Romans, the Byzantines, the Franks, the Hungarians, the Ottomans, and the Venetians).
Their influences permeated the region of Croatia, and were often in conflict with each other.
In the division caused by the schism in Christianity, Croatia leaned to the Western faction, at the same time forming the far eastern border of Western Christianity.
Long periods of conflict between mighty powers, punctuated by occasional times of peace, meant that the survival of Croatia was constantly jeopardised and national development hindered.
Several times, foreign powers organised their military defence systems on Croatian land (e.g.
the Frankish Eastern Line and the Austrian Military Border).
Croatia was also on the route of the deepest incursions made by the Ottoman Empire into Central Europe, which led to the contraction of the Croatian state and the shrinking of the Croatian ethnic area to the west.
The final consequence of this situation meant that Croatia was shaped along the unusual contours of its modern state territory, arching widely around neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The location of the country has brought it into contact with different cultures, traces of which can be found in various kinds of tangible and spiritual heritage, which today, alongside the original Croatian tradition, have been incorporated into the national identity and recognised in the European community of nations.
The direct consequence of belonging to different political centres throughout history was the long and drawn-out period during which the Croatian lands, today’s historical regions, were not united.
Under these circumstances, the political genesis of Croatia was slow and protracted.
After several centuries of political links with the Central European countries of Austria and Hungary, in 1918 Croatia became part of the Yugoslav state, whose centre of gravity was further east, so that through most of the 20th century, Croatian interests were subordinated to Yugoslav ones.
Nonetheless, within the framework of Yugoslavia, Croatia continued to develop its own potential and, occasionally, to express its own political goals.
In this situation of limited independence, Croatia succeeded after the Second World War in integrating most of its ethnic regions, then, during the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to mount a military defence and, after the collapse of the Eastern Bloc, to win the fight for international recognition.
Croatia’s sovereignty and western orientation have been affirmed by entry into the European Union, and, once again, the country is in the position of being a border, which places it in a unique position to participate in the process of extending the European Union to non-member countries, by showing its special interest in them, and also its understanding of them.

		Our beautiful homeland,
		Ever so fearless and gracious,
		Our fathers' ancient glory,
		May you be blessed forever.
You are our only glory,
		You are our only one,
		How we love your plains,
		How we love your mountains, too.
Sava, Drava, keep on flowing,
		Danube, do not lose your vigour,
		Deep blue sea, tell the world,
		That a Croat loves his homeland.
Whilst his fields are kissed by sunshine,
		Whilst his oaks are whipped by wild winds,
		Whilst his dear ones go to heaven,
		Whilst his vibrant heart beats.

	Anthem.
The national anthem is Lijepa naša domovino (Our Beautiful Homeland).
It first appeared during the period of national revival in the early 19th century.
The words were written by the poet Antun Mihanović and set to music by Josip Runjanin.
From 1891 onwards, it was the unofficial national anthem, and a monument to it was erected by the River Sutla in Croatian Zagorje in 1935.
It was declared the official anthem of the Socialist Republic of Croatia in 1972, and confirmed by the Constitution in 1990.
Flag.
The official Croatian flag has three colours, red, white and blue, with the state coat of arms in the centre, and has been in use since 1990.
The tricolour dates back to 1848, under the influence of the French Revolution, and was adopted as a means of linking the traditional heraldic colours of the historical Croatian lands.
The Croato--Hungarian Settlement of 1868 prescribed the use of the tricolour, and it continued to be prominent in the 20th century, right up to the declaration of state independence.
Coat of arms.
The coat of arms has also been in use since 1990.
It is a historical Croatian coat of arms in the shape of an escutcheon divided into 25 red and white (silver) fields.
Five smaller escutcheons in the crown above have historical roots and are (from left) the oldest known Croatian coat of arms, then the coats of arms of the Dubrovnik Republic, Dalmatia, Istria and Slavonia.
The historical Croatian coat of arms has appeared on different occasions from the 15th century on.
An example of it with 8 rows of 8 fields is found in the 1527 document which ratified the election by the Croatian Sabor of Ferdinand I of the Habsburgs as King of Croatia.
It later formed the basis for later Croatian coats of arms within the Habsburg Monarchy.
It was a component of the official coat of arms of the Socialist Republic of Croatia up to 1990.
National holidays.
Statehood Day is celebrated on 25 June, the date on which the Croatian Parliament (Sabor) declared the independence of the Republic of Croatia in 1991.
Other official national holidays are Independence Day (8 October), Victory and Homeland Thanksgiving Day and Day of Homeland Defenders (5 August), Anti-Fascist Struggle Day (22 June), International Workers’ Day (1 May) and New Year’s Day (1 January).
Some church holidays (Gregorian Calendar) are also non-working days: Epiphany, Easter Day, Corpus Christi, the Assumption, All Saints’ Day, Christmas Day and St. Stephen’s Day (Boxing Day).
Christmas Day according to the Julian Calendar is a non-working day for those of the Orthodox faith, Ramadan Bayram and Kurban Bayram for those of the Moslem faith, and Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur for those of the Jewish faith.

	Croatia is shaped like a horseshoe, stretching from Vukovar in the northeast, past Zagreb in the west, and to Dubrovnik in the far south.
It gained most of its present-day contours at the end of the 17th century.
With a surface area of 56,594 km², it is 19th among the European Union countries according to size, falling between Latvia and Slovakia.
In terms of relief and climate, it is extremely diverse.
The territory includes extensive plains in the continental region between the River Drava and River Sava (Slavonia), mountainous areas in the centre (Lika and Gorski Kotar), and in the west and south, a long, indented, sunny coastline with over a thousand islands (Istria and Dalmatia).
Croatia belongs to the Danube Basin and the Adriatic Sea and forms the Mediterranean front of Central Europe, positioned favourably in terms of geography and communications at the meeting point of important European corridors, while its harbours are used as sea exits by the neighbouring countries to the north.
Croatia is the third richest country in Europe in terms of natural water resources, and boasts a particularly well-preserved ecological environment, with hundreds of endemic plant and animal species.
Almost 10% of the country is protected within 11 nature parks, 8 national parks and two strict nature reserves.

	Contemporary Croatia, which gained independence in 1991, is the successor of the 9th century Croatian medieval prinicipalities established in the marches of the Carolingian Empire, followed by the Kingdom of Croatia, founded in 925 by King Tomislav.
Soon after the death of the last great Croatian king, Dmitar Zvonimir, Croatia entered into a personal union with Hungary, and in the 14th century, the throne belonged to the French Anjou dynasty.
After the Ottoman invasions in the 16th century and the loss of large tracts of land, Croatian dignitaries elected Ferdinand Habsburg as monarch in 1527, and the country remained within the Austrian Empire until 1918.
The first half of this period was marked by constant wars with the Ottomans and Venetian encroachment upon greater and greater areas along the coast (Istria and Dalmatia), apart from the far south, where the independent Dubrovnik Republic developed free trade in the Mediterranean between 1358 and 1808.
After the defeat of Venice and a short period in which southern Croatia was incorporated in Napoleon’s province of Illyria (1809–1813), all the Croatian lands were brought together within the Habsburg Monarchy, though they were still separate entities.
They were united briefly in 1848, during the Croatian national revival.
After the First World War, Croatia became part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, which was transformed after 1945 into a Communist federation, in which Croatia was one of six republics until 1991.
Although recognised as an independent state by the international community on 15 January 1992, Croatia was forced to defend its independence by armed struggle until 1995, when the occupied territories were liberated.
In 1992, Croatia became a member of the United Nations, in 2009, of NATO, and on 1 July 2013, of the European Union.

	Croatia is a parliamentary democracy and is organised as a unitary republic.
The social state, freedom, equality, equal rights and the rule of law are among the highest values of the constitutional order.
The political system is based on the principle of the division of power into three branches: the legislative, the executive and the judiciary.
In the Croatian parliament, or Sabor, which has a single house and has inherited many centuries of parliamentary tradition, its members are elected for four years.
The President of the Republic, who is elected by general, direct election for a period of five years, represents the country abroad, cooperates with the Government in shaping and implementing foreign policy and commands the armed forces.
The Government proposes laws and the State Budget, leads foreign and internal policy, and directs and monitors the work of the state administration.
Croatia is divided administratively into 20 counties and the City of Zagreb.
Alongside the judiciary, the institute of the Ombudsperson promotes and protects the legal rights of citizens.
There are also Ombudspersons for Children, Gender Equality, and Persons with Disabilities.

	With a population of 4.3 million, Croatia ranks 21st in the European Union, between Ireland and Lithuania.
About 60% of the population live in urban centres occupying less than 15% of the territory of the country, and of these, one in four lives in the capital, Zagreb.
As life expectancy has risen, almost a quarter of the population of Croatia is over 60 years of age, while about 15% is under 15.
In terms of nationality, Croats comprise 90% of the population.
The Roman Catholic Church is the largest religious confession (86%), followed by the Orthodox (4.4%; mostly Serbs, who also form the largest national minority), Muslims (1.5%) and Protestants (0.3%).
Croats also live in neighbouring countries as indigenous inhabitants, mostly in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The Croatian diaspora worldwide, from Australia to North and South America and Western Europe, comprises over two and a half million people.

	Since service industries comprise about two-thirds of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and agriculture accounts for less than 5%, the structure of the Croatian economy is similar to that of the countries of the European Union.
The main economic branches in the country are determined by natural resources, but also by technology and industry (shipbuilding, construction, petrochemicals, the food industry).
The most important branch of the economy is tourism, with 10 million foreign guests per year, contributing 15% to GDP.
As in many European countries, the greatest problem facing the Croatian economy in the current period of crisis is the relatively high level of unemployment.
Croatia has a developed infrastructure, and in the last 15 years, 1,000 km of modern highways have been built, which has contributed significantly to linking the countries of the European Union.
In fact, Croatia conducts almost two-thirds of foreign trade with these countries, primarily Italy, Germany, Slovenia and Austria, while Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia are also important trading partners.

	In alignment with European standards, Croatia’s higher education system has adopted the best features of the Bologna Process, contributing to the growing integration of science and scientists in Europe.
The modern Croatian education and science system is based on a tradition founded in 1396, when the first public university opened in Zadar.
The University of Zagreb, which is today the largest, dates back to 1669.
Among Croatian scientists and inventors, many have made particular contributions to international knowledge, especially Ruđer Bošković (1711–87) and Nikola Tesla (1856–1943).
The former was a Jesuit mathematician, astronomer, philosopher, diplomat and poet, came to prominence by producing an atomic theory and was one of the most renowned physicists of his day.
One of the craters on the Moon is named after him.
The modern system of transmitting electrical energy would have been unthinkable without the inventor Nikola Tesla, who created the first hydroelectric plant on the Niagara Falls, and invented the electric motor which we find today in almost all household appliances.
Other inventions which are now part of daily life, such as the tie, the parachute, the solid-ink fountain pen, the airship, the MP3 player and fingerprint identification techniques, are numbered among the products of Croatian creative minds.
Scientific excellence is best recognised through the Nobel Prize, and two Croatian chemists, Lavoslav Ružička (1939) and Vladimir Prelog (1975), have been awarded it.

	Always part of central European and Mediterranean cultural circles, or to be more precise, the meeting-point of Western civilisation and the East, the richness of Croatian culture testifies today to the links Croats have had with key European cultural epochs.
Among the visible traces of this are six monuments in the UNESCO World Heritage List: the untouched land division (parcelisation) of an Ancient Greek field in Stari Grad on Hvar, the Classical heart of Split with the palace of the Roman emperor Diocletian, the early Christian Euphrasian Basilica in Poreč, the Romanesque centre of the town of Trogir, the early Renaissance Cathedral of St. James in Šibenik, and Renaissance Dubrovnik.
Among great artists and writers, Marko Marulić (1450–1524), the “father of Croatian literature”, whose works were read throughout Europe, deserves special mention.
Juraj Dalmatinac (15th century) was the greatest Croatian Renaissance sculptor and architect, Julije Klović (1498–1578) the greatest Renaissance miniaturist, Luka Sorkočević (1734–89) the first Croatia composer of a symphony, Ivana Brlić-Mažuranić (1874–1938) the “Croatian Andersen”, Ivan Meštrović (1883–1962) the most famous sculptor, and according to Rodin “the greatest phenomenon among artists”, Milka Trnina (1863–1941) the greatest opera diva, and Miroslav Krleža (1893–1981), an encyclopaedist, was in many ways the greatest Croatian writer of the 20th century.
Among modern artists, Branko Lustig (1932), the producer of the Oscar-winning films Schindler’s List and Gladiator, the piano virtuoso Ivo Pogorelić and the duet 2Cellos are prominent.

	The traditional way of life in Croatia is characterised primarily by community, which is reflected in customs, crafts and folklore, and also in eating habits, with regional cuisines becoming more and more available to foreign guests as part of the tourist range of services.
Croatia is particularly proud of its top quality olive oil and selected indigenous wines.
The community spirit is also seen in sports and recreation – popular ways of spending leisure time.
In this sense, and due to the success of top sportsmen and women, Croatia is considered to be one of the top sporting countries of Europe.
Our sportspeople have often been high profile representatives of the country; among them are the basketball player Dražen Petrović, the footballer Davor Šuker, the tennis player Goran Ivanišević, the skiers Janica and Ivica Kostelić, and the national waterpolo and handball teams.

	Bearing in mind the specific features and influences which were interwoven in it, being as it is on the border between Eastern and Western civilizations, the root and expression of Croatian culture has always been unambiguously European.
Cultural relations of Croatia and Croats with other European nations and countries have a long tradition, dating back to the founding of the first Croatian duchies (9th century).
Those relations were multiplied with the later development of specific national cultures, and are today, especially in the framework of modern globalization processes, being fitted into worldwide culture, however retaining their recognizable identity.
Within today's European Union, several cultural circles can be identified – Central European, German, Italian, French and British – with which Croatia has had rewarding contacts through its history.

	It is impossible to provide an entire “cycle of knowledge” about Croatia, but it is worth mentioning that the concept describing such knowledge – the encyclopaedia – found its place in the title of a work by Croatian humanist Pavao Skalić as early as in 1559, from where it spread to all languages of the world.
In a similar fashion, the neck tie (cravat), which first appeared as part of the Croatian military uniform in the form of a picturesque adornment around the necks of Croatian soldiers in the Thirty Years War, was also accepted as a mark of elegance throughout the world.
Thanks to the Croatian computer programmer Tomislav Uzelac, MP3 Players have become an essential part of our everyday life.
Venetian explorer Marko Polo was born too early to possess such a player, but, according to some researchers, he is connected to Croatia by his family’s place of origin – the island of Korčula.
The Dalmatian dog, the best known indigenous Croatian canine breed, without which the famous Disney cartoon 101 Dalmatians would never have been made, also originates from the same part of Croatia.
In this chapter, you will find out many more interesting facts about Croatia...
The Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts is the oldest in Southeast Europe (1866) and has up to 160 full members (academicians) in its 9 departments.
It also encompasses several scientific-research and art institutes, as well as numerous scientific boards and councils.

	Scientific activities in Croatia are carried out in universities and their component departments, by the scientific institutes, as well as by the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts.
In 2010, over 11,000 scientists and researchers were employed in 234 scientific and research institutions; in that year, they published 10,014 scientific and research papers.
The largest science and art institution is the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts (HAZU), founded in Zagreb in 1866, thanks to the efforts of the Bishop of Đakovo, Josip Juraj Strossmayer (1815–1905).
It was called the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts (JAZU).
Its main task was to encourage and organise Croatian scientists, artists and those engaged in cultural activities and to promote their work abroad.
The Academy is divided into nine departments, and several scientific institutes.
It also operates a library, the Strossmayer Gallery of Old Masters, a Glyptotheque, a Graphics Office and Archives.

	The largest scientific and research institution in Croatia is the Ruđer Bošković Institute, founded in 1950, which operates in the area of research in the natural sciences.
Among other notable institutes are the Croatian Engineering Institute, the Ivo Pilar Institute of Social Sciences, the Institute for Ethnology and Folklore, the Institute of Physics of the University of Zagreb, the Institute for Croatian Language and Philology, the Croatian Institute for History, the Institute for Medical Research and Occupational Health, the Economics Institute, the Institute for Art History, the Institute for Oceanography and Fisheries in Split, the Agricultural Institute in Osijek, etc.
Scientists

	The first major contribution to Western European scholarship was made by Herman Dalmatin in the 12th century.
In the 14th and 15th centuries, Croatian scientists worked in European centres.
In the 16th century the Zadar doctor and physicist Frederik Grisogono produced a valuable theory on tides and promoted astrological medicine.
In the same century, the astronomers and natural philosophers Nikola Nalješković, Nikola Vitov Gučetić, Miho Monaldi and Antun Medo were working in Dubrovnik, while the foremost Croatian philosopher and scientist was Frane Petrić.
In the 17th century, the theologian and scientist Markantun de Dominis from Rab wrote on optics and the tides.
Marin Getaldić contributed to world mathematics, and the inventor Faust Vrančić made the first parachute.
The central figure of the 18th century was Ruđer Bošković, with his natural philosophy.
In the 19th century, several scientists worked in Hungary and Slovakia, among them the astronomer and mathematician Mirko Danijel Bogdanić and the physicist Franjo Josip Domin.
In the early 20th century, the geophysicist Andrija Mohorovičić made a great contribution to world science, as did the palaeontologist Dragutin Gorjanović-Kramberger, whose interpretation of his findings concerning prehistoric people in Krapina placed him among the founders of world palaeoanthropology.
In that period, the unique figure of Nikola Tesla stood out as an inventor and scientist.
During the 20th century, eminent scientists were at work in Croatia and abroad, for example the physicist Ivan Supek, and the Nobel prize winners Ružička and Prelog, and the tradition is continued today by Miroslav Radman and Ivan Đikić (chemistry), Davor Pavuna and Marin Soljačić (physics) and many others.

	Herman Dalmatin (c.1110–43), philosopher, theologian, astronomer and translator.
He translated Arabic astronomy and astrology texts into Latin, and was the first person to begin translating the Qur’an.
He translated Ptolemy’s Planisphaerium and revised a translation of Euclid’s Elements.
His major work was De essentiis, in which he set forth his own philosophical system.
Benedict Kotruljević (c.1416–69), diplomat and writer; moved to Naples in 1453.
He was the author of the first systematic European work on trade (On Trade and the Perfect Trader), and the first to write about double-entry bookkeeping.
Frane Petrić (Franciscus Patricius) (1529–97), philosopher and polymath.
He worked in Modena, Ferrara and Rome, where he taught philosophy as a Neo-Platonist and as an opponent of Aristotelianism.
He had a significant influence on the emergence of new Western European branches of science and philosophy.
In his works, he dealt with other branches of knowledge (geometry and the history of war).

	Ruđer Josip Bošković (1711–87), physicist, mathematician, astronomer and philosopher.
He was a Jesuit, professor of mathematics in Rome, Pavia and Milan, and Director of Optics for the French Navy in Paris.
He was a member of the Royal Society in London.
His major work was the Theory of Natural Philosophy, in which he constructed an original theory about forces and the structure of materials, which has received many affirmations through the discoveries of modern science.
He published many works describing original discoveries in the fields of mathematics, astronomy, geophysics and archaeology, and made many different optical, astronomical and geodetic instruments.
He carried out expert projects in hydro-technology, geodesy, cartography, statics and measuring (he fixed the cupola of St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome and the Cathedral in Milan).

	Andrija Mohorovičić (1857–1936), geophysicist.
From 1892 he was the Director of the Meteorological Observatory in Zagreb.
He worked in meteorology and seismology and introduced the exact time service.
His contribution to world science was his discovery in the Earth’s core of the Mohorovičić discontinuity (Moho), which leads to an acceleration in the spread of shock waves.
His discovery enabled the epicentres of earthquakes to be located precisely.
The Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts, the oldest in southeast Europe (1866), has up to 160 full members (academicians).

In accordance with legal tradition, the Croatian Parliament is traditionally titled the Sabor.
The oldest preserved records of Sabor sessions date back to 1273, although the beginnings of the Sabor are much earlier.
Alongside the Icelandic Althing, formed in 930, and the Parliament of Sicily, established in 1130, the Sabor is therefore one of the oldest Diets in Europe.

	In accordance with legal tradition, the Croatian Parliament is traditionally titled the Sabor.
The oldest preserved records of sessions of the Sabor date back to 1273.
Until the 16th century, the Slavonian and Croatian Sabors sat separately, but from 1681 they were united in the Sabor of the Kingdom of Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia (Congregatio Regnorum Croatiae, Dalmatiae et Slavoniae).
Until 1848, representatives were elected exclusively from the ranks of church dignitaries and the nobility, before the period when ordinary citizens were included.
Until 1847, the official language was Latin, and from then on, Croatian.
During the Second World War, the tradition of the Sabor was taken over by the ZAVNOH (National Anti-Fascist Council of the People’s Liberation of Croatia), which declared the National Sabor of Croatia in 1945.
A single-party Sabor was formed during the time of Yugoslavia, but real power was concentrated in the Communist League.
The first multiparty Sabor was constituted on 30 May 1990, and this day is celebrated as the Day of Hrvatski Sabor (Croatian Parliament Day).
Since then, seven Parliaments have been constituted.

	The Croatian Parliament is the representative body of its citizens and is vested with legislative power.
It has a minimum of 100, and a maximum of 160, members.
Members of Parliament have no imperative mandate and enjoy immunity.
The Croatian Parliament has a Speaker and one or more Deputy Speakers.
The Croatian Parliament decides on the adoption of or amendments to the Constitution, passes laws, adopts the State Budget, declares war or peace, adopts documents through which the policies of the Croatian Parliament are expressed, adopts strategies of national security and defence, carries out civil supervision of the armed forces and security services, decides on border changes, holds referenda, conducts elections, appointments and dismissals, supervises the work of the Government and other holders of public authority answerable to the Croatian Parliament, grants amnesty for criminal offences, and performs other work laid down in the Constitution.
The Parliament may establish investigative commissions for matters in the public interest.

Rožanski and Hajdučki Kukovi Strict Reserve, part of the North Velebit National Park.
The Velebit massif, spanning 145 km, is the longest mountain in Croatia and the fourth highest, culminating at 1,757 m, after Dinara (1831 m), Kame&scaron;nica (1809 m) and Biokovo (1762 m).

	Although the land area of Croatia is not large (56,594 km², 19th in size among the countries of the European Union), it has an extremely varied relief, as it adjoins several large European relief forms.
There are three main types of relief in Croatia: lowland Pannonian, mountainous Dinaric and coastal Adriatic.
The lowlands occupy the largest area, with 53% of the territory under 200 m, while 26% of the country is hilly, with peaks between 200 and 500 m, and 21% lies over 500 m above sea level.
The lowest areas are in the northeast region, which forms part of the Pannonian Plain, where the alluvial plains of the Sava, Drava and Danube alternate with the cinder plains of Baranja and Srijem.

	Further west, isolated, wooded peaks rise up from the plains to a maximum of 1,000 m (Psunj, Papuk and Krndija).
Along the edge of the Pannonian Plain is the hilly peri-Pannonian area with a large proportion of highland, sometimes exceeding 1,000 m absolute height (Medvednica, Ivančica, Žumberačka Gora).
The transition to the mountainous region is formed by the hills and limestone plateaus of Pokuplje and Kordun.
The real mountain region includes Gorski Kotar and Lika, with part of the Dinaric highland, basically lying NW-SE, with the highest mountains along the edges (Risnjak, Mala and Velika Kapela, Plješivica, Velebit and Dinara).
In Gorski Kotar there is a sharp contrast between the highland area and the deeply hewn river valleys of the Čabranka, Kupa and Dobra.
In inland Lika there are extensive karst fields (Plaščansko, Gacko, Ličko and Krbavsko).

	The coastal region extends from the mountains.
In the north, it includes the Istrian peninsula, while south of Rijeka the coastal belt is narrow, bordered by high mountains (Velebit) on one side and islands on the other.
The southern stretch of coastline corresponds to the historically established region of Dalmatia.
The main feature of this area is the dominant karst relief.
It is characterised by lengthwise zonality and the division into islands, the coastal belt and the hilly area of Zagora in the hinterland.
The coastal zone is proportionally narrow, bordered inland by steep mountain slopes.
It is widest and lowest in the flysch zones of Ravni Kotari in the north, in the central Kaštel region, and in the River Neretva delta in the south.
In the hinterland is Dalmatinska Zagora, a hilly region with several broad karst fields (Sinjsko and Imotsko).

	About half the territory of Croatia is karst land, while part of the wider region is composed of the same material, Dinaric karst, named after the Croatian mountain, and continues into Slovenia in the northwest and Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro in the east and southeast.
Karst land is characterised by the predominantly underground circulation of water through porous carbonate rock (limestone, dolomite).
As the water dissolves calcium carbonate, it creates characteristic surface formations (sink-holes, clefts, valleys, fields) and underground formations (chasms, caves, grottos).
About 50 caves deeper than 250 metres have been discovered.
Lukina Jama in the Hajdučki Kukovi region, in the Northern Velebit National Park, is among the 20 deepest caves in the world (explored to a depth of 1,421 m).

	Rivers arise from powerful sources, and may flow over or underground before emerging again at ground level in lower lying areas.
Submarine sweet water springs known as vrulje are common.
The karst land may be forested or completely bare.
Within Europe, Croatia is considered to be one of the classic karst countries.
Almost all formations have developed, so some Croatian names for particular karst shapes have been adopted in international scientific terminology.
The karst region includes the largest reserves of underground drinking water, which require special protection from the dangers of pollution.
Since the level of preservation is high, the Croatian karst region is of exceptional natural value in European terms.

Croatia is administratively divided into 20 counties and the City of Zagreb, which has the status of a county.
Each county has particular competence for general education, health, land use, economic development, transport and its infrastructure, and the development of educational and cultural institutions.

	The basic units of regional self-government are the counties (županija in Croatian).
The present administrative territorial division of the country was introduced in 1997, when the 1992 division was changed.
Smaller administrative territorial units within counties are cities/towns in urban areas, and municipalities in other areas.
According to the 2006 Act, Croatia has 127 towns/cities and 429 municipalities.
The county, as a unit of territorial division in Croatia, has a long history.
Counties are mentioned as early as the 10th century, first in the southern part of the country, and later in the north.
They continued to exist up to the 20th century, in different numbers and with changing territorial ranges, means of organisation and powers.
After the demilitarisation of the Military Border in 1881, there were 8 counties in the Kingdom of Croatia and Slavonia: Modruš-Rijeka, Lika-Krbava, Zagreb, Varaždin, Bjelovar-Križevac, Požega, Virovitica and Srijem.

At the Cetin Sabor in 1527, the Croatian nobles elected Ferdinand I of the Habsburg dynasty, independently of Hungary, as their king, thus affirming Croatian statehood.

	After the death of the last member of the Trpimirović dynasty, King Stjepan II, there was a battle for the throne in Croatia, which ended with the election of the Hungarian king, Coloman from the Arpad dynasty, and the contracting of a personal union with Hungary, which lasted until 1918.
Within Within the new state union, Croatia retained territorial integrity until the reign of Bela IV (1235–79), who founded Slavonia as a new unit of the Croatian-Hungarian Kingdom, in the area which was formerly the Pannonian Principality.
Its seat was Zagreb.
At the same time, the Venetians conquered much of Dalmatia, while the regions by the central courses of the Vrbas and Sana rivers belonged to Bosnia.
After the Arpad dynasty died out, a war of succession ensued.
The Venetians took the remaining Croatian towns in Dalmatia, while the Bosnian rulers took southern Croatia from the Cetina River to the Neretva River.

	In 1309, Croatia came under the rule of Charles I Robert, from the Naples branch of the Anjou dynasty.
His son, Louis I (Louis the Great) again united Croatia and Slavonia, seized back the territories occupied by Bosnia (1357) and the Venetians (the eastern shore of the Adriatic from Istria to the Bay of Kotor, in 1358), and enabled economic development and integration processes to take place from the Drava River to the Adriatic Sea.

	During the reign of Louis’ heir, in the late 14th and early 15th centuries, a dynastic war developed, of which the Venetian Republic and Bosnia took advantage, again extending their territories into Croatian lands.
It was during this period that Dubrovnik began to arise in the far south of Croatia, built on the foundations of strong maritime, trade and crafts traditions, developing a rich culture, diplomacy, pharmacies and social institutions, and introducing mains water and a sewer system, among other things.

	In the mid 15th century, the Ottomans began to press forward into Croatian lands, particularly after Bosnia fell under their rule in 1463.
Their advance was halted by King Matthias Corvinus (ruled from 1458 to 1490), by the construction of a strong fortification system on the eastern borders of Croatia and Slavonia.
However, defences were weakened after a victory by the Ottomans at the Battle of Krbava Field in 1493, in which the Croatian nobility was decimated.

	‘The Bulwark of Christianity’.
Antemurale christianitatis was the Latin expression used in diplomatic correspondence to describe Croatia (a letter from Pope Leo X sent in 1519 to the Croatian ban Petar Berislavić).
Simultaneously, the phrase ‘remnants of the remnants’ (reliquiae reliquiarum) was also used, an abbreviation for the ‘remnants of the remnants of the once great and glorious Kingdom of Croatia’ (reliquiae reliquiarum olim magni et inclyti regni Croatiae).
Following the death of the last Croatian-Hungarian king, Louis II Jagiellon in the Battle of Mohács, the Croatian nobles elected Ferdinand I of the Habsburg dynasty as ruler in 1527.
He opposed the pretender John Zápolya and fought against the Ottomans.
In order to strengthen the defences of Zagreb, the first joint Sabor (Parliament) of the Croatian and Slavonian nobility was held in 1558, at which the Croatian lands were united politically.
The Ottoman occupation of Croatian lands was halted in 1593 by the Battle of Sisak, and the Habsburgs established the Military Border for defence purposes in the border areas.
The Military Border was not reunited with Croatia until 1881.

	The dissatisfaction of the Croatian nobility with the commandeering of Croatian land, the desultoriness of the Habsburgs in terms of mounting a defence against the Ottomans, and their interference in the authority of the Croatian ban and the Sabor resulted in a failed anti-Habsburg plot in 1671, led by the ban Petar Zrinski and Fran Krsto Frankapan.
The Habsburgs used the opportunity of crushing the plot to introduce absolute power over Croatia and Hungary.

Suleiman’s Bridge in Osijek.
The most famous Ottoman construction in Croatia.
It was built in 1566 according to the designs of Koca Mimar Sinan and was nicknamed ‘the eighth wonder of the world’.
It was burned down by the Croatian ban Nikola VII Zrinski in a conflict with the Ottomans.
The deaths of the Croatian nobles Petar Zrinski and Fran Krsto Frankapan, the bearers of the tradition of the Croatian state and the proponents of greater independence, took place in 1671 in Wiener Neustadt.
Croatia in the early 17th century
The Battle of Sisak.
The battle for the fortress of Sisak was fought between the Croatian-Austrian and Ottoman armies from 15 to 22 June 1593.
The victory at Sisak brought a permanent halt to the advances of the Ottomans to the west and their occupation of Croatian lands, and created military equilibrium on the border with the Ottoman Empire.
The amphitheatre in Pula, known as the Arena, built in the first century, the sixth largest in the Roman Empire, could host 25,000 spectators.
Today, it is used for large cultural and sporting events.

	Thanks to trade routes and communications, the ancient peoples of the Bronze and Iron Ages living in the land which is present-day Croatia were in touch with the artistic output of the Greek and Etruscans from as early as the 8th century BC, but it was only with the arrival of the Greek colonists in the 4th century BC that conditions were established for the wider spread of classical civilisation on the eastern Adriatic coast.
Through the Greek colonies, such as Issa (Vis) and Pharos (Stari Grad, on the island of Hvar), Greek influence spread, as evidenced in the script, coinage, trade, parcelisation of land and building of city walls.

	From the 2nd century BC onwards, Rome gradually established power and created administrative regions – the provinces of Dalmatia and Pannonia.
Cultural and economic development with the characteristics of Roman civilisation (urbanism, architecture, sculpture, cults, coinage and trade) first arose on the Adriatic coast, then further in the deep hinterland.
Many settlements took on the characteristics of Roman towns (Parentium/Poreč, Salona/Solin, Iader/Zadar, Narona/Vid, near Metković, Aenona/Nin, Varvaria/Bribir) and forum complexes were built with basilicas, curias, thermal spas, etc.
There were also grand public buildings, particularly theatres (Pola/Pula, Salona/Solin) and amphitheatres (Pola, Salona, Burnum/Ivoševci, near Kistanje).

	In the Pannonian area thermal spa towns sprang up (Aquae Iasae/Varaždinske Toplice) and important towns, of which only a little of the architecture has been preserved (Siscia/Sisak, Marsonia/Slavonski Brod, Mursa/Osijek, Cibalae/Vinkovci).
A special place among all these was held by Diocletian’s Palace in Split.
Special achievements of Roman and Hellenistic building were the country estates of Brijuni and also Polače on the island of Mljet, roads (Salona-Sirmium, Emona-Sirmium), bridges and aqueducts (Diocletian’s Aqueduct).

	After Constantine’s edict on tolerance issued in 313, early Christian art began to flourish in a natural symbiosis with classical culture.
The most important monuments of early Christian sacred architecture are found in Salona, and there are particularly important early Christian graveyards north of the town (Marusinac, Manastirine, Kapljuč).
After the Byzantine Empire, the eastern heir of the Roman Empire, became the main political force in Italy and on the eastern Adriatic in the mid 6th century, a series of forts were built to defend and control the shipping route, of which the Byzantine castrum on Veli Brijun is a fine example.
The Euphrasian Basilica complex in Poreč is another magnificent architectural monument from that period.

	At the end of the 6th century, high classical civilisation began to wane in Croatia.
The reason for this was the economic disintegration of the towns due to ever more frequent raids by “barbarian” tribes.

	The coexistence of two types of performance in Croatian ecclesiastical music was the outcome of medieval European culture: Gregorian chant (preserved in the late 11th century Neum Codex) developed in Dalmatia and Istria into Glagolitic chant, first in Old Slavonic, then in Croatian, which has been maintained to the present day through oral tradition.
In the centuries which followed, vocal musical forms dominated, composed by people who were either born on the coast or had connections to it.
During the Renaissance, Julije Skjavetić of Šibenik was a prominent composer, the author of a collection of madrigals and motets.
The early Baroque period was the golden age of Croatian music; Ivan Lukačić was composing in Split, the Italian Tomaso Cechinni on Hvar, and Vinko Jelić, from Rijeka, published a collection of motets in Strasbourg.
In the late Baroque period, the church singer and opera composer Ivan Šibenčanin worked in England and Italy.

	The Classical period introduced the first prominent compositions for instruments.
In Dubrovnik, Luka Sorkočević composed eight three-movement symphonies in the pre-classical style, while his son, Antun Sorkočević, composed chamber music, and the poetess and artist Jelena Pucić-Sorkočević was numbered among prominent Croatian composers for her solo songs.
In Split, Julije Bajamonti, a doctor, polymath, organist and composer of the first Croatian oratorio, Prijenos Sv.
Dujma (The Translation of St. Domnius) (1770), and the Requiem for Ruđer Bošković (1787), was active.
The organ builder Petar Nakić built about fifteen organs in Istria and Dalmatia and over 300 in Italy in the first half of the 18th century.
The violin virtuoso Ivan Jarnović achieved worldwide fame and was the composer of a score of violin concertos; he was also the first person in the music world to introduce the romance as a slow movement.

	Musical events in the 19th century gravitated towards northern Croatia.
In 1827, the Musikverein was founded in Zagreb (today’s Hrvatski Glazbeni Zavod – HGK), the oldest music institution in the country, with a comprehensive musical library.
In 1876, the HGK opened the first public concert hall in Zagreb, and in 1829, founded a School of Music, which became the Conservatory in 1916, then the Academy of Music of 1922.
The early Romantic Nocturne in F sharp major for piano, by Ferdo Livadić (1822), along with the nocturnes of the English composer, John Field, is considered one of the earliest works of its kind in European music.
The enthusiasm of the Illyrian Movement, which reflected the spirit of romantic nationalism among the other Slavic people led Vatroslav Lisinski to compose the first national opera, Ljubav i zloba (Love and Malice) in 1846.
Ivan Zajc was a major figure in the second half of the 19th century, with an opus which included the opera Nikola Šubić Zrinjski.
He was also the Director of the Opera and Music School of the HGZ.

	In the early 20th century, the leading composer of modern music was Blagoje Bersa (Sunčana polja – Sunlit Fields, a symphonic poem).
In the generation of composers who were named the ‘new national trend’, the most prominent were Josip Štolcer Slavenski (who was acclaimed in Donaueschingen in 1924), Krešimir Baranović (Licitarsko srce – The Gingerbread Heart 1924, the first modern Croatian ballet), Jakov Gotovac (Ero s onoga svijeta – Ero the Joker, the most popular Croatian opera) and Fran Lhotka (Đavo u selu – Devil in the Village, the most successful Croatian ballet).
Boris Papandopulo produced a rich, stylistically diverse opus (Symphonietta for Strings), and represented a bridge to the later 20th century, when representatives of the avant-garde were spearheaded by the composer Milko Keleman (Transfiguration) and Ivo Malec (Cantate pour elle), with Stanko Horvat, Ruben Radica, Anđelko Klobučar, Dubravko Detoni, Igor Kuljerić joining them.
The outstanding composers of the late 20th century are Marko Ruždjak, Frano Parač, Davorin Kempf and Ivo Josipović, who is present-day President of Republic.

	Great Croatian artists of the 20th century include the conductors Lovro Matačić, Milan Horvat, Berislav Klobučar and Vjekoslav Šutej, the bassoonist Rudolf Klepac, the horn player Radovan Vlatković, the pianist Ivo Pogorelić, and singers such as Zinka Kunc-Milanov, Dragica Martinis, Tomislav Neralić, Vladimir Ruždjak, Marijana Radev, Sena Jurinac, Ljiljana Molnar-Talajić, Ruža Pospiš-Baldani and Dunja Vejzović.

Cello teaching reached world levels through the efforts of the Italian artist, Antonio Janigro, who also founded the Zagreb Soloists, and the composers Rudolf Matz and Valter Dešpalj.
In recent times, Monika Leskovar and the duo 2Cellos have assumed the mantle of fame.
Several international competitions are held in Zagreb: the Vaclav Huml prize for violinists, the Lovro Matačić prize for conductors, the Antonio Janigro prize for cellists and the Svetislav Stančić prize for pianists.

	The most highly regarded Croatian orchestras are the Zagreb Philharmonic Orchestra and the Croatian Radio and Television Symphony Orchestra, whose choir and Big Band are also esteemed, while among chamber ensembles with an international reputation, the Zagreb Quartet and Zagreb Soloists are prominent.
The most popular Croatian operettas are Mala Floramye (1925) and Splitski Akvarel (1928) by Ivo Tijardović, and the first Croatian rock opera, Gubec-beg (1975), by Ivica Krajač, Karlo Metikoš and Miljenko Prohaska, achieved great popularity.

The international Zagreb Jazz Fair had a great influence on the younger generation in the 1980s and 1990s, and the current jazz scene in Croatia continues to thrive.

	Pop music has experienced several high points, from the first hits of the 1920s and 1930s (Vlaho Paljetak), through the biggest star of the mid century, Ivo Robić, nicknamed ‘Mr.
Morgen’ for his popularity in Germany, and the Zagreb chanson school of the early 1960s, made famous by Arsen Dedić, Hrvoje Hegedušić and Zvonko Špišić, to the victory of the pop group Riva at the Eurovision Song Contest in Lausanne in 1989 (Rock Me).
The reputation of the international rock scene in the 1960s was enhanced by the singer and composer Karlo Metikoš, known abroad as Matt Collins (Ritam kiše), and the oldest rock groups which are still going today are Parni valjak and Prljavo kazalište.
Ivan Lukačić (1587–1648) reached the heights of European early Baroque music with his collection of motets, Sacrae cantiones.

The crowning of the Croatian King Tomislav, Oton Iveković (detail, 1904-1905).
Tomislav was crowned as the first Croatian king in 925.

	The names Croat and Croatia in its present-day territory have gradually superseded the ethnically wider concept of the Slavs and their first territorial groupings, Sklavonija, Slovinje (Sclaviniae), and the individual names of the ancient Illyrian tribes and their territories (e.g.
the Dalmati, Liburni), the Roman coastal populations (Romani, Latini) and other earlier tribes who settled during the Migration Period (the German Goths, the Eurasian Avars, etc.).
The religious division of western and eastern Christianity later influenced national identification, particularly in connection with the migration of the Slavenized Vlachs, and in the era of the Ottoman invasions and migrations of refugees from the “Turkish” (Bosnian) side, so that in the 19th century, at the time of the formation of nations, the Catholic population (generally, but not exclusively) declared itself to be Croatian, the Orthodox Serbian, and the Muslim “Turkish”.
Older Croatian writers sometimes call their language Slavic, or Slovinic and, during one period, Illyrian, in addition to Croatian.
These different names are not necessarily contradictory, but rather emerged from the interwoven strands of the multi-layered historical components of the Croatian people, their culture and state, which have been joined in the modern age by other European migratory currents – German, Italian, Czech, Hungarian, Slovakian, etc.

	At the time of the creation of the first European states from the ashes of the Roman Empire, as with other European peoples, it was crucial in Western Europe to be acknowledged by Rome and the papacy, and in Eastern Europe, by Constantinople and the Byzantine Emperor.
The Croats found themselves on the dividing line between the two.
The best known, most comprehensive Byzantine source text was written by the Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus (De administrando Imperio – c. 949–955).
According to him, the Croats came from what is today southern Poland (White Croatia), at the invitation of Emperor Heraclius I (610–641), and imposed their rule upon the Avars and their Slav allies at the time.
A treaty between the Croats and Pope Agatho (678–681) is suggested to be the first act of diplomacy, according to which Croats who had already been baptised vowed to refrain from incursions into other lands, and in return, the pope promised assistance should another people attempt to occupy their land; according to such sources, the Croats were the first Slavic nation to be baptised.
However, the “arrival of the Croats” and the credibility of certain historical sources continue to be subjects of debate in contemporary historiography.
Croatia entered the 9th century, which saw the creation of the first principalities, on the divide between the Franks and the Byzantines.
Duke (in Croatian: Knez) Borna (810–821), who was according to Frankish sources dux Dalmatiae atque Liburniae, aligned himself with the dominant Frankish powers, with whose assistance he resolved the conflict with the rival duke of (Slavic) Pannonia, Ljudevit Posavski.
Borna attended in person the conclusion of the Aachen Peace Treaty (812) between Charlemagne and the Byzantine Emperor Michael I Rhangabes, according to which Pannonian Croatia (and Istria) came under Frankish, while the Dalmatian coast and towns fell under Byzantine sovereignty.

	The power of the local dukes, however, gradually increased, as the external powers continued to confront each other.
Duke Trpimir (845–864) stood out as the first strong ruler, founding the ruling Trpimirović dynasty.
Although under Frankish supremacy, he succeeded in waging war independently against Byzantium and Venice, and against Bulgaria, which was a strong power at that time.
In documents, he called himself ‘Duke of Croatia by the grace of God’ (Dux Chroatorum iuvatus munere divino), with no reference to imperial rule.
When the Saxon theologian Gottschalk, accused of heresy by the Franks, took refuge at Trpimir’s court, where he obviously felt safe, he called him ‘King of the Slavs’ (Rex Sclavorum).
Following the hegemony of Byzantium in the era of Duke Zdeslav and the conflict between Rome and Patriarch Photius of Constantinople, Prince Branimir (dux, comes, princeps) came to power in Croatia (879–892), aided by Pope John VIII.
Branimir aligned Croatia permanently with Rome and western civilisation, succeeded in imposing a peace tribute (tributum pacis) on the Dalmatian towns and the Venetians, who had been defeated at sea (887), and began to implement policies independently from the Franks.
In letters dated 879, the pope acknowledged his rule over his entire “earthly principality” and in 880 legalised church services in Church Slavonic.
The disciples of St. Methodius, who had been exiled by the Franks, came to Croatia from Great Moravia, spreading Slavonic worship and literacy in a special Slavic (Glagolitic) script.
The first regal title in Croatia, according to traditional historiography, was accepted in 925 by Tomislav, granted by Pope John X, who dubbed him rex Croatorum.
King Tomislav is credited with uniting the Croatian lands “from the Adriatic to the Drava”, suppressing Hungarian incursions, and achieving a solid victory over the army of the Bulgarian Emperor Simeon (927).
Many streets and squares in Croatia today bear Tomislav’s name.
Regal titles acknowledged by the Holy See were also taken by the later so-called native rulers, of whom the most important was Petar Krešimir IV (1058–74).
In a founding document of the Benedictine monastery on Rab (1059), Croatia is called a kingdom (Croatiae Dalmatieque regnum), and the Adriatic described as ‘in our Dalmatian sea’ (in nostro dalmatico mari).
The last powerful Croatian king from the native dynasty was Dmitar Zvonimir (1075–89), who fought against the Franks (Germans) in Istria and was crowned by Pope Gregory VII, who sent him a crown through the legate Gebizon.
His strong link with the Holy See was confirmed by a papal declaration that any hostile act against Croatia would be considered an attack on the Apostolic See of St. Peter, while Croatia (with Dalmatia) was affirmed as a kingdom (regnum Dalmatiae et Chroatiae).
Zvonimir also ruled over Slavonia, and his wife Jelena was the sister of the Hungarian king Ladislaus, of the Arpad dynasty.
After his death, the status of Croatia as an independent factor in European political relations changed.
The Hungarian Arpad dynasty claimed the right to the Croatian throne, partly through the line of Queen Jelena, and seized it at a moment of dynastic disintegration, during the war for the throne.

	Relations between Croatia and Hungary have often been the topic of political and historical controversy.
A document known as Pacta conventa (Agreed Accords, 1102), in which the Hungarian King Coloman was acknowledged as King of Croatia and the rights of the Croatian nobility regulated, has survived only in the form of a 14th century copy.
The Pacta was not contested for a long time.
It was only in the period of rising nationalism in the mid 19th century that the Hungarian side challenged them, while the Croatian side built the self-identity of the state upon them.
However, it is a fact that, according to these Accords, or others of the time, the Hungarian king was crowned king of Croatia separately, while the institutions of the Croatian Sabor (Parliament) and Croatian Ban (Governor) were confirmed, and that the Croatian-Hungarian union was originally established as a personal union.
The state independence of Croatia within the union reached full expression at the crucial moment of the struggle for survival of the Croatian-Hungarian Kingdom, after its army suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of the Ottomans at the Battle of Mohács, when the Croatian, Hungarian (and Czech) King Louis II of the Jagiellon dynasty was killed.
At an independent session of the Croatian Sabor held in Cetin (1527), the Austrian Archduke Ferdinand Habsburg (1503–64) was elected King of Croatia.
Meanwhile, the Hungarian parliament decided for John Zápolya, who was in fact under the patronage of the Ottoman ruler Suleiman I.
At that time, Ferdinand guaranteed that all the former freedoms, rights, laws and customs of Croatia would continue to be respected, and this was recorded in a charter bearing the seal of the Kingdom of Croatia.
Through Ferdinand, Croatia became part of the long-lasting Habsburg Monarchy.
Although the unification of the countries was carried out as the union of separate kingdoms, the Habsburgs began to centralise the monarchy, so that Vienna increasingly became the centre of political decision-making.

	The millennial relations between Croatia and Venice, a maritime power, were extremely complex, ranging from periods of fierce naval and land conflicts to periods of cooperation and combined defence strategies.
In Venetian dialect, almost up to the modern period, the Croats were known as Slavs (Schiavi, Schiavoni), while the later Vlach population of the Dalmatian hinterland were called Morlacchi.
Domagoj, Croatian Duke from 864, and according to the chronicler Johannes Diaconus ‘the worst duke of the Slavs’ (pessimus Sclavorum dux), plundered the Venetian navy.
Duke Branimir, in an alliance with the Duchy of Neretva, following a naval victory in a battle off Makarska in 887, in which the Venetian Doge Petar I Candiano was killed, imposed a tribute on Venice in return for unhindered sailing, which the Venetians continued to pay for over a hundred years.
Nonetheless, the ‘Queen of the Sea’ gradually resumed strength.
The Venetian Doge Petar II Orseolo took control of most of the Dalmatian coast from 1000 onwards, and proclaimed himself dux Dalmatiae.
However, a century later, the Dalmatian towns came mostly under the rule of the Croatian-Hungarian kings, until 1409.
Conflict continued to flare between Croatia and Venice, with varying success.
Thus in 1202, Venice conquered Zadar, with the aid of a Crusader army, by promising them transport to Constantinople.
The Istrian and Dalmatian towns under Venetian rule often rebelled, attempting to maintain their privileges.
Ladislaus of Naples, the defeated pretender to the Croatian-Hungarian throne, granted Venice the “right” to govern Dalmatia for the price of 100,000 ducats in 1409.
With this kind of background in international law, and with the emergence of Ottoman threats in the Dalmatian hinterland, Venice took on a genuine defensive role for the Christian population of Dalmatia.
There was fierce fighting on land and at sea, often leading to the relocation of the ethnically close, if not identical, Muslim and Christian inhabitants.
The Požarevac Peace Treaty of 1718 established the border of Venetian Dalmatia and “Turkey”, which today forms the border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The Dubrovnik Republic has special significance in the history of Croatian statehood.
In the 12th century, the Arabian geographer Muhammed al-Idrisi mentioned Dubrovnik as the most southerly town of “Croatia and Dalmatia”.
The city state was founded on the strict obligations of the patricians, as the bearers of power: their maxim was inscribed on the Prince’s Palace and declares, ‘Forget your private affairs, care for public matters’ (Obliti privatorum publica curate).
Dubrovnik also came under the sovereignty of various neighbouring powers of that time, yet it always succeeded in maintaining complete internal autonomy, often with special privileges, particularly trading privileges.
Freeing itself formally from Venetian supervision in 1358, it paid a tribute of 500 ducats per year to the Croatian-Hungarian king, which later became a tribute of 12,500 ducats paid to the Ottoman sultan.
Dubrovnik was in every way an independent state, with its own diplomatic representatives spread throughout Europe and with strong merchant emporiums in Southeast Europe and the Middle East.
It had close links with Florence and the Florentine popes during their “golden age”.
Dubrovnik grew into a respectable rival to Venice in the Mediterranean, while its diplomacy affected the relationships between European states and the Sublime Porte, so that from time to time the French used Dubrovnik as a mediator (for example with Serafin Gučetić at the conclusion of the Franco-Turkish treaty of 1536).
The city’s wealth, out of proportion to its size, enabled exceptional communal achievements, such as the first modern sewage system, the first quarantine facilities for ships, organised health care, including the oldest pharmacy in Europe that is still active today, the first known law on maritime insurance and many more, including the law prohibiting slavery, which was adopted in 1416 (compared to 1542 in Spain and 1569 in England).
Under the flag of its patron saint, St. Blaise, and with the motto of the city, Libertas, when Napoleon abolished the Republic in 1808, some of the Dubrovnik nobility vowed not to marry rather than produce offspring “in slavery”.
The Croatian nobility, which emerged from ancient lineages (tribes), independently of the statehood position of Croatia, from time to time assumed considerable powers, even beyond those of the king.
So Pavao I Bribirski (1273–1312), in a dynastic conflict about the Croatian-Hungarian line to the throne, installed the House of Anjou (Charles I Robert – 1301–42), while he himself, with the title “Ban of the Croats and Lord of Bosnia”, ruled as “the uncrowned Croatian king” from the Sava to the Adriatic, including Bosnia.
This aristocratic line, particularly in the later Zrinski branch, along with huge possessions in Croatia and Hungary, gave rise to famous warriors (Nikola Šubić Zrinski, the defender of Siget) and also dangerous opponents to the absolutism of the Austrian Emperor Leopold I.
In 1671, Petar Zrinski and Fran Krsto Frankapan, a scion of the second most powerful Croatian aristocratic family, were sentenced to death for conspiracy, and both were executed in Wiener Neustadt.
With the confiscation of all their property, the two most powerful Croatian aristocratic families were destroyed.

	The statehood status of Croatia as a separate kingdom within the Habsburg Monarchy became a particularly burning issue in relation to the potential inheritance of the Habsburg throne through the female line.
Since Charles VI had no son, the Croatian Sabor published the Pragmatic Sanction in 1712, acknowledging his daughter, Maria Theresa, as Queen of Croatia, along with her right to inherit the throne, although this was at first opposed by the Hungarian parliament.
During Maria Theresa’s reign, Croatia was a kingdom on the south-eastern edges of a monarchy which extended all the way to Belgium.
While it could hardly be claimed that Croatia and Belgium entered into a particularly significant relationship at that time (apart from the heraldic aspect), Croatian MPs in the modern European Parliament in Brussels should remind themselves that they are not the first to find themselves part of the same community as Belgium (and many other countries).
The ambivalent relationship between the Croatian Sabor and Hungarian parliament, as the bodies of state power in two kingdoms, and their joint relationship with Vienna as the actual centre of state power, gradually shifted towards the increasing role of a joint parliament, in which the Hungarians held the majority of seats.
Nonetheless, it was possible for Croatian representatives at the joint parliament to veto decisions made regarding Croatia, while their proposals in connection with Croatian affairs could be rejected only by the king himself.
As early as 1790, at a joint session of the two parliaments in Buda, the Croatian delegation rejected a proposal for a law introducing the Hungarian language in Croatia, with the famous statement Regnum regno non praescribit leges (One kingdom does not prescribe laws for the other).
Napoleon’s construction of Europe took into account the specificity of the “Illyrian” southeast, from Trieste to the Bay of Kotor.
The Illyrian Provinces (1809–13), with their seat in Ljubljana, besides Slovenia covered most of the Croatian lands (south of the River Sava to the Adriatic coast), while the majority of the population was Croatian.
As a product of French administration, under the special authority of Marshal Marmont, the province did not have the status of a state, but neither was it an integral part of the French Empire.
Although it did not last long, Napoleon’s Illyria spawned the modernisation of the Croatian lands, from road infrastructure to education in Croatian (“Illyrian”), and the appearance of the first newspapers in Croatian (Kraljski Dalmatin, in Zadar, 1806–19).
The influence of French modernisation soon came to full expression in the Illyrian Movement, better known as the Croatian National Revival.
Croatia within complex state communities, as other European countries in similar situations, independently could not play a role in international relations, in more or less centralised states of which it was a part, from the Croatian-Hungarian Kingdom, the Habsburg Monarchy, Austria-Hungary, to the two Yugoslavias (the unitary kingdom and the socialist federation).
Nonetheless, Croatia in principle entered all these communities “voluntarily”, by decision of the Croatian Sabor (the aristocracy, upper classes or representatives of the people), and pursuant to the acknowledgement of Croatian state rights, except in the case of the formation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, i.e.
the later Kingdom of Yugoslavia.
“Croatian Right to Statehood” was a phrase of particular meaning in the political consciousness of Croatia.
Although Croatia, from the time of the native rulers, which ended in 1102, remained for over 900 years within the framework of multinational state communities, with the exception of the Dubrovnik Republic, whether as a kingdom, a ban’s province or a republic, its right to statehood was always accepted as the basic right of the Croatian people to self-determination, i.e.
to their own statehood, which did not actually mean it could be established, but it could not be contested.
After the collapse of Austria-Hungary and the formation of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs in the former southern Slavic region of the monarchy (again by a decision of the Sabor, in 1918), the formation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (from 1929 known as the Kingdom of Yugoslavia) was carried out by the Serbian government in contravention of the Corfu Declaration (1917), that is, the agreement reached by the Serbian government with leading politicians from the former Austro-Hungarian lands (the Yugoslav Committee).
The Constitutional Assembly declared, with the simple (unqualified) majority of representatives present, the unitary Vidovdan Constitution in 1921.
The Croatian representatives abstained, as did the representatives of the leftist faction.
From then on, along with other unresolved issues, the particularly crucial “Croatian Question” continued to raise its head in Yugoslavia.

	The assassination of Croatian representatives at the National Assembly (1928), which resulted in the death of Stjepan Radić, leader of the Croatian Peasants’ Party (HSS), particularly strained national relations.
For the first time on the international scene, a Croatian militant national emigration policy emerged (Ustasha), which aimed at the destruction of Yugoslavia, and included the use of terrorist methods (participation in the assassination of King Alexander I Karađorđević in Marseilles in 1934).
On the other hand, the illegal Communist opposition, bolstered by international connections, became more and more active, particularly in Zagreb and Croatia.
Its aim was to topple the Kingdom and set up a “federative republic of equal nations” through revolutionary means, taking Soviet Russia as its example

	Monarchist Yugoslavia and democracy could not go hand in hand; that particular version of Yugoslavia never had a democratically adopted constitution.
Primarily with the assistance of para-state groups (the Orjuna in Croatia; the Chetniks in Serbia), then by the introduction of a personal dictatorship in 1929, which banned political parties, imposed police terrorist tactics, and had “republicans” murdered, King Alexander proclaimed the Octroyed Constitution in 1931, which was never taken out of effect.
In this context, and accompanying a deep state crisis on the eve of the Second World War, the leading Croatian and some Serbian politicians forged the Cvetković–Maček Agreement, by which the Banovina of Croatia was established as an autonomous territorial unit within the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, led by the Ban and the Sabor.
Thus, for a short time, by a decree issued by the royal vice-regency, a certain degree of Croatian sovereignty was established, without this being constitutionally defined and without international (foreign-policy), security and defence autonomy.
In opposition to the Ustasha movement in Croatia, the ally of the Axis powers during the Second World War, which formed a quisling Independent State of Croatia (NDH), abandoning large tracts of Croatia to the occupying powers, and approving wide-ranging criminal offences accompanied by a terrorist form of government, which became thoroughly compromised among the people, the Communists, led by the Croat Josip Broz Tito, organised a mass anti-Fascist uprising, which was at the same time a “national revolution”.
Taking the initiative during the war, and holding most of Croatia, the Communists (in cooperation with part of the Croatian Peasants’ Party and the representatives of the Serbs), formed the highest representative bodies of “the government of the people”.
The anti-Fascist Movement in Croatia was one of the strongest Partisan movements in occupied Europe.
Within it, the ZAVNOH (National Anti-Fascist Council of the People's Liberation of Croatia) was formed, which in June 1943 took over the remit of the Croatian Sabor and at its third session (in Topusko, in May 1944), declared itself the supreme legislative and executive representative body and highest body of state power in Croatia.
At this time, the decision to create the Democratic Federative Yugoslavia, with the Federal State of Croatia as one of the future Yugoslav republics, was adopted.
In the Federal People’s Republic of Yugoslavia (FNRJ, 1945–63), Croatia was one of the republics with defined borders which were extended to include areas with majority Croatian populations (Istria, Rijeka, Zadar and the islands) which had belonged to Italy during monarchist Yugoslavia, or had been annexed under the Fascist occupation.
Although the Yugoslav republics were defined in principle as states with the right to self-determination, government was in fact not only centralised, but also rigidly Communist in ideology.
In the immediate post-war period, the historical and politically most important Croatian Peasants’ Party was banned, while many of its members, who were also anti-Fascists, were indicted and given severe prison sentences.
This led to a new wave of political emigration, in which democratic politicians were also involved, along with the remnants of the nationalist “defeated forces”.
Socialist Yugoslavia, during its 50 years of existence (from 1963–1991 known as the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia), significantly changed the political characteristics of power, yet always remained under the strict supervision of the Communist Party and the emphatic personal authority (or cult status) of Marshal Tito.
There was relative democratisation during the mid 1960s, but after a mass democratic movement in Croatia which insisted on greater autonomy for Croatia (the Croatian Spring, in 1971), and the resulting settling of accounts with its political bearers (1972), the 1974 Constitution granted wider rights to the republics as states.
However, majority vote decision-making was maintained through majority voting in the Federal Council and through the institute of joint decisions in the assembly chambers.
A certain degree of freedom was allowed in terms of the republic’s international activities, so that Croatia (and Slovenia), along with certain Italian, Hungarian, Austrian and German regions, became a founding member of the regional Alps-Adriatic Working Community.
The role of the Communist League of Croatia was based on the “unity of the Communist League of Yugoslavia” as a whole.
This unity was crucial to maintaining Yugoslavia as a country.
Although based primarily on an emphatic pro-Soviet Communist ideology, the later withdrawal of Yugoslavia from the Soviet bloc (1948) and its links with the West from the early 1950s onwards (including the military aid of the USA), along with the complexity of internal national relations, demanded other political solutions, even within the Communist League.
Some of these solutions leaned towards democracy (the introduction of “self-management socialism”) and decentralisation (the right of the republics to retain a portion of their revenue from the economy and local communities).
However, such solutions always led to conflicts between the “dogmatists” (centralists) and “democrats” (federalists), and were never fully carried through.
The culmination of these conflicts was reached during the 14th Congress of the Communist League of Yugoslavia held in Belgrade in January 1990, when first the Slovene, then the Croatian delegation disagreed with the Serbian leadership and walked out.
This led to an open breach in the unity of the Communist League and raised the entire question of the disintegration of Yugoslavia as a community of states.

	The modern Republic of Croatia chieved state independence by means of an imposed war.
In contrast to the collapse of other socialist multinational states (Czechoslovakia, and most of the USSR), and in spite of the constitutionally guaranteed right of each republic to “self-determination until secession”, it proved impossible to achieve Croatian state independence by peaceful means, even though this was the declared will of the people according to a referendum held in May 1991 (94.17% in favour).
Militant secessionist Serbian groups in Croatia, the political leadership of Serbia and Yugoslavia, along with the JNA (army), assisted by extremist paramilitary (Chetnik) groups from Serbia, began open aggression against Croatia.
After successfully defending the country during the Homeland War (1991–95), including the liberation of occupied territories and the peaceful reintegration of other, smaller areas (1998), Croatia at last achieved full state independence, within the same borders it had had as a Yugoslav republic.
The first international recognition of the new state came during the Homeland War (first by Iceland, in December 1991), while other European countries followed up to the end of January 1992, and on 22 May 1992, Croatia became a member of the United Nations.

	Thanks to its position in the moderate climate belt along the 45th parallel, Croatia enjoys a predominantly moderate climate, with four clearly marked seasons.
Local climate differences are determined primarily by the diversity of the relief and proximity to the Adriatic Sea.
The range of the main climate types on the whole corresponds to the three main relief types.

Celebrating Croatia’s admission into the UN on the main square in Zagreb upon the return of President Tuđman from New York on 24 May 1992.
Croatia declared its independence on 25 June 1991, confirmed this decision on 8 October 1991 at the expiration of the moratorium, and was recognised by the international community on 15 January 1992.

	The process of the emergence of the contemporary state of Croatia began with the crisis in Communism in Eastern Europe in the late 1980s, the strengthening of democratic movements and the restoration of multi-party systems.
Such movements, from the Baltic Sea to the Adriatic, proved to be aligned on the side of national demands for self-determination, which in turn led to the collapse of multi-national socialist states and the independence of their federal components.
In Croatia, this process had many specific aspects and was not accomplished by peaceful means, much against the will of the Croatian people.
For them, the struggle for democracy also meant the struggle for a Croatian state.
After the death of President Josip Broz Tito in 1980, Yugoslavia descended into an economic and social crisis; political confrontations between the leaders of the republics were renewed regarding the issue of ordering the state, political pluralism, the republic’s economy and other matters.
Different national demands were expressed more strongly, as was unitarian Yugoslavism, particularly in Serbia, some federal institutions and the top ranks of the Yugoslav National Army (JNA).

	At the end of 1989, the reformist tendency in the leadership of the Croatian League of Communists (SKH) prevailed, which led to calling the first free, multi-party elections.
These were held in April and May 1990, and the winning party was the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), the party which guaranteed the protection of national interests.
The leader of HDZ, Franjo Tuđman, was elected in the Parliament as President.
This was followed by the adoption of a new Constitution (22 December 1990) and following a referendum (19 May 1991), the Declaration on the Proclamation of the Sovereign, Independent Republic of Croatia was adopted (25 June 1991).
There followed the adoption of the Ruling on the abrogation of public law relations with the remaining republics and provinces of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY), i.e.
Yugoslavia as an entity (8 October 1991).
Through the disintegration of the SFRY, which it had itself incited, the political leadership of Serbia, headed by Slobodan Milošević, implemented Greater Serbian policies, calling for all Serbs to unite in battle.
By manipulating the position of the Serbian population of Croatia, in late July and early August 1990 Milošević incited a rebellion by Serbian extremists, who declared an “autonomous Serbian nation” on 30 September 1990 and then the Autonomous Region of Krajina on 21 December, which on 1 April 1991 declared its secession from Croatia and annexation to Serbia.
The ethnic divisions were also encouraged by the rise of national intolerance on the Croatian side.

	Armed conflict broke out in April 1991, as the JNA gradually joined the Serbian rebels.
On 26 June 1991, the Parliament adopted the Defence Act, by which the Croatian armed forces were organised.
They were considerably weaker than the JNA, which had confiscated arms meant for territorial defence of Croatia in 1990.
From August 1991 onwards, initial skirmishes grew into direct aggression by the JNA, Serbia and Montenegro, so that Croatia was forced to fight a defensive war, known as the Homeland War, in which 14,000 people were to die by the time it ended in 1995.
From the end of 1991, about 26.5% of Croatia (an area of some 15,000 km²) was controlled by Serbian rebel forces; the “Republic of Serbian Krajina” was declared in part of that territory (19 December 1991).
The Croatian population was terrorised and driven out; by the end of 1991 there were about 550,000 exiles fleeing armed conflict, joined later by a further 200,000 refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina.
During the autumn of 1991, many Croatian towns were exposed to artillery and mortar attacks (Vinkovci, Osijek, Karlovac, Sisak, Gospić, Zadar, Šibenik, Dubrovnik and others).
Vukovar was particularly severely damaged, where between the end of August and the middle of November 1991, about 2,000 people were killed in attacks by the JNA and Serbian paramilitary forces (about 1,100 of these were civilians).
Although Serbian forces finally entered Vukovar, it became a symbol of the Croatian struggle for independence through the heroic defence mounted by its people.

	In order to resolve the Yugoslav crisis, the European Community (EC) initiated a peace conference in September 1991, and its Arbitration Committee concluded on 7 December 1991 that the SFRY was “in the process of disintegration”.
Therefore, the EC members decided on 16 December 1991 to acknowledge the independence of the Yugoslav republics within existing borders, on condition that they fulfilled certain democratic principles.
Thus, on 15 January 1992, the independence of Croatia and Slovenia was recognised, and on 24 May 1992 they were accepted into the United Nations (UN).
After about fifteen failed attempts, a mutual truce between the Croatian forces and the JNA was achieved on 2 January 1992.
This enabled the UN to set up peace operations in Croatia.
UN Protected Areas (UNPA) under the auspices of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) were established in the area with a majority Serbian population and in neighbouring areas that were also occupied.
The JNA withdrew from Croatia and provided strategic support for Serbian forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), where war broke out in early April 1992.
This war produced added complications for the geopolitical and strategic circumstances in which Croatia was defending her independence, since the rebel Serbs in Croatia had aligned their war operations with Serbian forces in BiH, and in the political sense, with the self-proclaimed Republika Srpska.

	The winner of the parliamentary and presidential elections in August 1992 was HDZ and its presidential candidate, Franjo Tuđman (he was re-elected in 1997).
From May 1990 to his death in late 1999, President Tuđman was the key player in Croatian internal and foreign policy.
Under his influence, a semi-presidential system of government was put in place.
Military and political events in Croatia in the first half of the 1990s were closely linked to those in BiH.
The joint resistance of Croats and Bosnians was accompanied by differences and disagreements which grew into armed conflict in 1993–94.
Influenced by the United States of America (the signing of the Washington Agreement on 18 March 1994), a strategic alliance of Croatian and Bosnian leadership in BiH was established.
Croatia also signed a Memorandum on cooperation in defence and military relations with the USA.
Successful military operations by Croatian forces in western BiH followed, which also weakened the position of Serbian rebels in Croatia.
The rebel leadership rejected Croatian and international initiatives to end the war in Croatia by reaching a settlement (a plan for wide autonomy for the areas with majority Serbian populations was rejected in January 1995).
After a series of unsuccessful attempts at negotiation, in 1995 Croatia took back most of the occupied areas by military means – in the limited operation known as Flash (1 and 2 May) and the wider-ranging operation known as Storm (4-7 August), in which the Serbian rebel forces were definitively defeated.
As they retreated towards BiH and Serbia, the Serbian population began to flee en masse – it is estimated that more than 150,000 Serbs left Croatia during Operation Storm.
Operation Storm was also caused by events in BiH: genocide committed against Bosnians in Srebrenica, in spite of UN surveillance, and the threat of renewed crimes in Bihać near the border with Croatia.
After these operations, the only part of Croatia still under occupation was the wider Danube region along the border with Serbia (about 4.5% of the territory).
A process of peaceful integration was agreed in November 1995, during negotiations between the Croatian, Bosnian and Serbian sides in Dayton (mediated by the USA and the international Contact Group); the agreement was signed on 12 November 1995 in Zagreb and Erdut (Basic Agreement on Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Srijem, known as the Erdut Agreement).
Then the UN Transitional Administration in Eastern Slavonia (UNTAES) was established which, in cooperation with the Croatian authorities and local Serbian population, allowed the area to be reintegrated into the Croatian state and legal system.
This was the first UN mission in the former Yugoslavia to be completed within the given deadlines.
Thus, a difficult period of military and political trials came to an end for Croatia (1991–98), during which the country had defended state independence and territorial integrity.
Disputes remained with her neighbours, countries which came into being as a result of the collapse of Yugoslavia (Slovenia, B&H, Montenegro and Serbia), regarding individual border issues, which however did not seriously disrupt the establishment of interstate and regional cooperation.
The most complex issue proved to be the maritime border between Croatia and Slovenia (an agreement on international arbitration was reached in 2009).

	The road to the European Union.
Since deSince declaring independence in 1991, the key goal of Croatian foreign policy has been rapprochement with the EC and inclusion in the processes of European integration.
As a Central European and Mediterranean country in the transitional area towards the Balkans, and given its historical experiences, Croatia maintained that gravitating to the West was the most natural geopolitical choice.
On the eve of the collapse of Yugoslavia and during the Homeland War, EC member states at first encouraged regional negotiating processes, then organised humanitarian and financial aid for Croatia, and supported her independence (in January 1992).
However, relations between Croatia and the EC (from 1993 the European Union – EU) during the next few years were at a low level.
Croatia was criticised for a lack of progress in the development of human and minority rights, and accused of violating the rules of war.
Criticisms were also received due to insufficient cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (established in 1993 on Croatia’s initiative).

	Although some of those accused were later freed (e.g.
General Ante Gotovina and General Mladen Markač), thus proving some of the complaints issued by the Hague prosecution to have been unfounded, Croatia was seen to be part of the general instability in the post-Yugoslav scene, so the process of rapprochement with the EU dragged out.
The political influence of the HDZ weakened after the death of Franjo Tuđman (1999).
At presidential elections held in 2000, the victor was Stjepan Mesić, who was re-elected in 2005 and remained in office until 2010.
Coalition of democratic parties came to power following the 2000 elections.
Their government held a moderate left position until the end of 2003, during which time the Prime Minister was Ivica Račan, president of the Social Democratic Party of Croatia (SDP; in the early 1990s, Račan had spearheaded the reformation of the Croatian League of Communists into SDP).
Constitutional amendments adopted in 2001 abandoned the semi-presidential system; the powers of the president were reduced and the role of the Parliament and government strengthened.
The early years of the new millennium were a period of post-war democratisation and more intense activity directed towards accession to the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO).
Croatia strengthened strategic cooperation with the USA and NATO in May 2000, by entering the Partnership for Peace programme.

	Progress in Croatian relations with the EU was marked by the signing of the Agreement on Stabilisation and Association on 29 October 2001 (entered into force on 1 February 2005).
After an agreement between all Croatian parliamentary parties on accession to the EU was reached, the application for membership was submitted on 21 February 2003.
The continuity of integrated efforts was maintained after a change in government.
In 2003 and 2007, HDZ again won parliamentary elections, and the prime ministers from their ranks were Ivo Sanader (2003–09) and Jadranka Kosor (2009–11).
Ivo Josipović, the SDP candidate, won the presidential election in 2010.
At parliamentary elections in December 2011, a coalition of four left-of-centre parties won, and the president of SDP, Zoran Milanović, became prime minister.

	Croatia was given the status of candidate country for EU membership on 18 June 2004, and accession negotiations began on 3 October 2005.
Croatia achieved an important foreign policy goal on 1 April 2009, by becoming a member of NATO.
At the end of June 2011, the accession negotiations were formally completed and on 9 December 2011, the Agreement on the Accession of Croatia to the European Union was signed (entered into force 1 July 2013).
A referendum held on 22 January 2012 showed that two-thirds of those who voted (66.27%) were in favour of accession.
At the end of 2011, the fifteen-year-long work of the Organisation for European Security and Cooperation (OESC) came to an end, which had been initiated in order to process war crimes committed in Croatia between 1991 and 1995, and supervise the return of refugees and the exercise of their rights.
Foreign policy

	International recognition and membership in the UN in 1992 enabled Croatia to adopt an independent approach to foreign policy, which until the mid 1990s was overshadowed by the events of war.
It has only been post-war circumstances which have allowed the stronger international affirmation of Croatia, as confirmed by membership in NATO (2009) and the European Union (2013).
Participation in Euro-Atlantic security and economic integration has been the most momentous goal of Croatian foreign policy.
In this context, bilateral relations have been developed with the countries of the European Union and the USA.
At the same time, Croatian foreign policy has included other aspects of bilateral and multilateral activities, and many interstate relations have been established throughout the world.
Membership in all important international organisations and institutions has been achieved (OSCE, WTO, etc).
As a country with a dramatic experience of war, Croatia has continued to contribute within the framework of the UN to peaceful conflict resolution in the world – in 2008–09 Croatia was a temporary member of the Security Council.

	After the end of the Homeland War, Croatian involvement in the processes of regional cooperation and stabilisation has been through the Central European Free Trade Agreement, the Stability Pact for Southeastern Europe, and separate initiatives of the countries of the Danube region and of the Mediterranean, etc.
Croatia developed diplomatic relations with most neighbouring countries immediately after international recognition (Italy, Hungary, Slovenia and BiH).
In 1996 diplomatic relations were also established with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and after its collapse in 2006, with Serbia and Montenegro.
The The participation of Croatia and other post-Yugoslav countries in the processes of regional political stabilisation make the historical burdens of the past, including war, more complex.
This has been particularly expressed in the relations between Croatia and Serbia, while on the other hand, there has been greater success in restoring relations with Montenegro.
The legacy of the Yugoslav period includes issues such as individual border disputes, complex proprietary relations between the newly-formed states, the problems of the return of refugees, etc.
Croatia is attempting to address these issues in accordance with international law and on the basis of mutual inter-state agreements.
This approach has, among other things, facilitated Croatia’s membership in the European Union.

	Since 1999, Croatia participated in around twenty UN, NATO and EU peacekeeping operations and missions throughout the world.
From 2005 to 2007, Croatian General Dragutin Repinc was the commander of an observer mission (UNMOGIP) on the disputed border between India and Pakistan in Kashmir.
In early 2013, about 120 members of the Croatian armed forces participated in 7 UN missions, the majority (96) in the Golan Heights as part of an international observer force (UNDOF – United Nations Disengagement Observer Force).
Since 2003, Croatia has been active in Afghanistan, as part of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) under NATO command, whose present composition includes 332 members of the Croatian armed forces.
Since 2009, about twenty Croatian soldiers have been part of the international Kosovo Force (KFOR), also under NATO command.

	The first Slavic tribes arrived in the area which is modern-day Croatia in the 6th and 7th centuries, during great tribal migrations.
Among them were the Croats, who are mentioned in sources in connection with a wider area, but were ethnically most concentrated and historically the strongest in the hinterland of the Adriatic coastline.

	In the late 8th and early 9th centuries, they came under Frankish rule (Charlemagne), and were organised in two adjoining principalities (Marks) governed by local princes.
The Principality of Dalmatian Croatia, with its seat in the Knin area, was established in what is today the coastal, mountainous area of southern Croatia, while the Principality of Pannonian Croatia was established in the lowlands of northern Croatia, with its seat in Sisak.

	In the late 9th century, the Pannonian Principality fell under the rule of the Hungarians, while power in the south was assumed by the Trpimirović dynasty.
This dynasty began to ascend during the time of Tomislav (914–928), who expanded Croatia to the area of the Pannonian principality, and who in 925 was crowned as the first Croatian king.
The Trpimirović dynasty reached its zenith with King Petar Krešimir IV (1054–78) and Dmitar Zvonimir (1078–89), when the Byzantine Dalmatia and Neretva Principality were annexed to Croatia.
Their reigns were characterised by a blossoming of culture, particularly in building and sculpture.
The first written monuments of the Croatian language date back to this period (the Baška Tablet).
Jelena (?–976).
Jelena was a Croatian queen and wife of King Mihajlo Krešimir II (ruled 950–969) and the mother of King Držislav Stjepan (ruled 969–997).
On her headstone, which was discovered in 1898, the royal title rex and genealogical details regarding the Trpimirović dynasty are recorded.
Croatian principalities in the 9th century
Knin.
From the time of the reign of the Trpimirović dynasty, Knin was the occasional seat of the Croatian rulers, and from the time of Dmitar Zvonimir, the permanent seat of the Croatian Kingdom, where from the 12th to 14th centuries, the herceg (duke) and the ban (governor) ruled alternately, and the sabor (parliament) held sessions.
St. Blaise.
St. Blaise was Bishop of the City of Sebastea, a Christian martyr (mid 3rd century to c. 316), and patron saint of the city of Dubrovnik since 1190.
Dubrovnik developed from a fishing village in the early 7th century.
It belonged at different times to the Byzantines, Normans, Venetians and the Croatian-Hungarian Kingdom, while from 1358 to 1808 it was an independent aristocratic republic.
It traded in the Mediterranean, Levant and the Balkans.

Apart from its unspoiled nature, this park is also a place steeped in history, since the Declaration establishing the Non-Aligned Movement was signed there in 1956, during the Cold War.

	A large number of protected natural areas and features show that Croatia is a country of exceptional, diverse, and comparatively well-preserved natural beauty, of which some examples, such as the Plitvice Lakes, are famous throughout the world.
The first legal norms in Croatia by which natural goods were protected date back to the 13th century, when deforestation in the area of Trogir, Korčula and Dubrovnik was restricted.
The movement to protect nature, founded by experts, began in the 19th century.
The Nature Protection Act defines 9 categories of spatial protection, and the most beautiful, most valuable protected areas comprise two strict reserves, eight national parks and eleven nature parks.

	Bijele Stijene and Samarske Stijene in Gorski Kotar and Hajdučki Kukovi and Rožanski Kukovi, in the area of North Velebit National Park, areas with irreplaceable natural features, are strict reserves.

	National parks cover extensive, unique areas with one or more preserved ecosystems.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park and the Krka National Park boast unique karst morphology and hydrology, with magnificent travertine waterfalls and lakes.
Kornati and Mljet are island national parks with unique landscapes and abundant underwater worlds.
The Brijuni islands include cultivated parks and valuable cultural and historical heritage from classical times.
Risnjak, Paklenica and North Velebit are mountainous areas with characteristic relief features, such as many limestone rocks and deep canyons, with high meadows and extensive woods, home to many endemic species.

	A nature park is a partially cultivated area with important ecological features, in which certain economic activities are permitted.
Of the 11 nature parks in Croatia, 6 are in the mountains (Velebit, Biokovo, Medvednica, Papuk, Učka and Žumberak–Samobor Heights).
Telašćica and Lastovo islands are island parks whose qualities include a wide range of land and marine biodiversity.
Kopački Rit and Lonjsko Polje are low-lying wetlands, habitats for rare animal species and home to original folk architecture.
Vransko Lake is an especially important ornithological site for nesting and overwintering.

	National and nature parks cover a total surface area of 5,151 km², which is 9.1% of the country.
Other protected nature categories are special reserves, regional parks, natural monuments, important landscapes, forest parks and monumental park architecture.
All nature protection activities are managed by the State Agency for Nature Protection.

	Certain protected areas have been included in the international system for nature protection.
The Plitvice Lakes are on the World Natural Heritage List; Mount Velebit and the Mura–Drava–Danube regional park are part of an international network of biosphere reserves (Man and the Biosphere – MAB), while Kopački Rit, Lonjsko Polje, the Neretva Delta, Crna Mlaka and Vransko Lake (since 2013) are on the international list of valuable wetlands (Ramsar Convention).
Papuk Nature Park is part of the European network of geoparks.

	With Croatia’s entry into the EU, all protected areas, along with those which have been recognised as valuable, will become part of the Nature 2000 ecological network of land and marine sites.
Endemic flora and fauna

	The flora of Croatia is characterised by biological diversity (biodiversity) and has its own peculiar quality.
In terms of the number of plant species found, Croatia is ahead of most European countries.
Due to climate differences and the position of coastal areas, which are in the Mediterranean region, the vegetation in such areas is quite different in composition and appearance from the lowland and mountainous areas inland, which belong to the Euro-Siberian region.
This is particular evident in forest vegetation, but can also be seen in other types of ground cover.

	Apart from biological diversity, peculiarity is also important, as reflected in the large number of endemic species, mostly on the Adriatic islands and mountain ranges of Biokovo and Velebit.
There are 8,871 species and subspecies of Croatian flora (according to some estimates, over 10,000), of which 526 (about 6%) are endemic, and 1,088 (about 12%) protected.

	Croatian fauna consists of all animal species which live permanently or occasionally in the country.
In Croatia, there is an overlap of a range of animal species characteristic of northern Europe and those which mostly live in the western or eastern Mediterranean.

	According to current knowledge, there are 23,876 species and subspecies of Croatian fauna, of which 565 (2.4%) are endemic and 1,624 (6.8%) protected.
Endemic species are found in almost all animal groups, but most are found among species which live in the karst region and the rivers which flow into the Adriatic, and on the islands.
There are 88 species of fish in the karst rivers of the Adriatic confluence, of which 41 are endemic, while over 50% of reptiles are endemic.
The underground karst world is even more diverse: the Dinaric karst has the highest density of troglobite species in the world (80).

The most famous Croatian historical regions are Dalmatia, lying along most of the Adriatic coast with its islands, Slavonia, bordered by the Drava, Danube and Sava rivers, and Istria, the main peninsula in the northern Adriatic.

	The region of modern Croatia covers a large number of historical and geographical regions of different origins and size.
These reflect the political fragmentation of the Croatian lands in the past, and partly also the position of Croatia at the meeting-point of several large, geographical, European components.
The best known historical regions are Dalmatia, Slavonia and Istria.
Historical regions

	The original Roman province of Dalmatia extended along the east coast of the Adriatic Sea, but also included a significant part of the hinterland, which today belongs to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Byzantine Dalmatia, on the other hand, included only a few coastal towns and neighbouring islands.
The region which is considered to be Dalmatia today was formed as a Venetian territory on the eastern Adriatic by the late 17th and early 18 century.
This territory, enlarged by the addition of the Dubrovnik Republic in the 19th century, formed a separate province within the Habsburg Empire.

	The peninsula in the north of the eastern Adriatic has been called Istria since Roman times.
In the 19th century, it formed a separate unit within the Habsburg Empire.
Although its population was predominantly Croatian, it was only formally annexed to Croatia after the Second World War.

	The name Slavonia used to refer to a larger area than today – it covered the entire region north of the Velika and Mala Kapela mountain range.
From the 18th century onwards, the name came to be used for the eastern, lowland area of modern-day Croatia, and formed part of the title of the Croatian political core area within the Habsburg Empire – the Kingdom of Croatia and Slavonia.
Other historical and geographical names relate to smaller regions, whose borders are sometimes not clearly defined.
The northeast region of Baranja was once part of a Hungarian county of the same name, but has been part of Croatia since 1945.
The most eastern part of Slavonia is known as Srijem, and is the relic of a once much larger region, most of which belongs to Serbia today.
Lika, Banovina, Kordun and Žumberak are smaller regions, which were wholly or partially under the separately administrated Military Frontier set up by the Habsburg Empire on what is Croatian soil today.
The Military Frontier was re-integrated with the main Croatian territories in 1881.

	Some of these names and other names of regions appear in the names of modern counties, the basic units of the administrative division of the country, but they have exclusively geographical significance and do not denote any particular political status.
Contemporary regions

	Contemporary regional divisions basically follow the relief division of the country.
The northern, predominantly lowland part of the country is divided into Eastern and Central Croatia.
Eastern Croatia includes the traditional regions of Slavonia, Baranja and the western part of Srijem, i.e.
the actual lowland area of the Pannonian Plain, bordered by the largest rivers, the Sava, Drava and Danube.
This area boasts the optimal conditions for agricultural production.
The main regional capital is Osijek, a port on the Drava.
Other large towns include Vinkovci, a transport hub, Vukovar, the largest river port and the only Danube port in the country, Slavonski Brod, Požega and Đakovo.

	Central Croatia includes the border areas of the Pannonian Plain and the peri-Pannonian regions of Croatian Zagorje, Međimurje, Pokuplje and Banovina.
It is the centre of gravity in terms of population and the economy, with the country’s capital, Zagreb.
Other large towns and regional centres are Varaždin, Čakovec and Krapina in the north part of the region, Karlovac and Sisak in the south and Bjelovar and Koprivnica in the east.
Highland Croatia is the smallest, least populated region, and includes the country’s mountainous area.
It is composed of smaller units, particularly the forested Gorski Kotar, the Ogulin–Plaški depression and Lika.
Due to the relief and climate, there is little arable land, and only cultures which can withstand severe winter conditions are grown there.
Forestry based on local resources is the dominant branch of the economy.
The towns are smaller than in other parts of the country, and the regional centres are Delnice, Ogulin and Gospić.

	The coastal part of the country is usually divided into north and south.
The Northern Litoral area includes Istria, the most developed tourist region, and the long, narrow Kvarner region below Velebit, with the islands which belong to it.
The largest town and regional centre is Rijeka, the largest Croatian port.
Other large towns include Pula and Poreč in Istria, and Senj in the coastal belt below Velebit, while there are particular tourist centres such as Rovinj and Opatija, and the island centres of Krk, Rab and Mali Lošinj.
The Southern Litoral forms the historical region of Dalmatia.
In terms of climate, landscape and culture, it is a specifically Mediterranean region, within which three parallel belts can be distinguished: the islands, the coast and the hinterland.
The regional centre is Split, the second largest city in Croatia and the largest on the coast.
Other important regional and economic centres include the coastal towns of Zadar, Šibenik and Dubrovnik, and the inland towns of Knin and Sinj.

Brinje Tunnel, on the A1 motorway, was awarded the FIA prize in Brussels in 2008 as one of the safest tunnel in Europe.

	As an Adriatic, Central European country, and part of the Danube valley, Croatia enjoys a favourable geo-communication position.
Thus several pan-European transport corridors and their branches pass through Croatia, as defined at a ministerial conference in 1997 in Helsinki: Corridor X links Central Europe and the Near East, while branches of Corridor V link northern and southern Europe with final destinations in Croatian ports.
Croatian sea ports have traditionally been points of exit for several Central European land-locked countries (Austria, Hungary, Slovakia, Czech Republic) and for neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina.

	Due to the shape and indentation of its territory, good transport communications are important for Croatia too, particularly in linking the interior with the coast, and the Pannonian region with the Adriatic front.
In terms of transport communications, optimum solutions direct Croatia to Bosnia and Herzegovina and vice versa.
In addition, the narrow B&H exit to the sea near Neum divides the territory of Croatia into two sections.
A suitable solution is still being sought in order to fully link the Dubrovnik coastal region with the rest of Croatia, and this has become a subject of international interest as Croatia enters the European Union.
One possibility is a highway, which would form one section of the Adriatic-Ionian highway project, along the Croatian coast from Italy to Greece.
Otherwise, about 1,000 km of modern highways have been built in the last 15 years in international corridors.
There is a long tradition of building transport communications in Croatia.
The first modern roads were built as early as the 18th century, leading from the interior to the northern Adriatic ports, while the first railway line was built in 1862, linking Zagreb by a branch line to the main Vienna–Trieste line.
Road transport is the most developed, most important form of land communication, and transports the greatest amount of passenger and goods traffic.
The existing highway network is well developed and enables good connections within the country.
Croatia has seven international airports and three smaller airfields for small commercial aeroplanes.
Sea ports are of particular significance in the transport network.
The largest, most important Croatian port is Rijeka, followed by Ploče, which handles all the traffic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The other Croatian ports are primarily important as passenger terminals and provide communication between the mainland and islands.
The total length of inland waterways is 804 km, and international traffic primarily uses the Danube (for which the main port is Vukovar) and, to a lesser extent, the Drava and Sava.
The Danube waterway, in which Croatia participates, is one of the pan-European transport corridors (VII).
Plans have been drawn up for a Danube–Sava canal to link the waterways.
The current state of transport communications is satisfactory in terms of road traffic, particularly the extent of highway connections.
Particular deficiencies exist in the renovation and modernisation of the railway infrastructure and inland waterways.

Croatian Revival, by Vlaho Bukovac, the curtain at the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb.
Croatia has 60 professional theatres where more than 8,733 performances were given in 2012 to over 1.7 million viewers.
In addition, more than 2,800 performances were put on in children's theatres, and more than 1,100 in amateur theatres.

	The earliest examples of theatrical life in Croatia, as in other Western countries, were liturgical dramas in Latin.
However, secular theatre appeared as early as the beginning of the 14th century in Dubrovnik, which over the next centuries emerged as the leading theatrical centre and the largest Croatian stage.
It reached its zenith in the highly-developed theatrical forms of the 16th and 17th centuries, in which the original comedy theatre pieces of Marin Držić were dominant, and in various dramatic forms of a particularly Baroque character (Ivan Gundulić and Junije Palmotić).
This was an era in which other Croatian centres joined enthusiastically in theatrical life, whether in Dalmatia (Hvar and Zadar) or especially inland (Zagreb, Varaždin and Osijek), where a major role was played by Jesuit school productions, and performances were gradually relocated from public buildings to theatres.
In 1834 a theatre opened on St. Mark’s Square in Zagreb, which in the Renaissance period, thanks to the efforts of Dimitrija Demeter, began gradually to organise Croatian professional theatrical life.
The first performance in Croatian (Juran i Sofija, by Ivan Kukuljević Sakcinski), was staged in 1840, and the first opera (Ljubav i zloba, by Vatroslav Lisinski) in 1846.

	Up to 1860, German theatre companies continued to perform alongside their Croatian counterparts, but after the official institutionalisation of the national theatre in 1861, during the next decade August Šenoa, as artistic director, redirected the repertoire towards Slav and Romance authors.
At the end of the 19th century, Stjepan Miletić became the theatre manager, having acquired experience through studying the European stage, which he brought to his homeland, carrying out reforms which during his tenure were characterised by the important impulses of modern Croatian theatre.
Between the two World Wars, all theatrical issues were affected by political interference.
However, under the management of Julije Benešić in the 1920s, the directorship of Branko Gavella and the work of scenographer Ljubo Babić, the Zagreb theatre achieved a high level of artistic performance, while other Croatian theatres succeeded in maintaining their independence.
After 1945, a series of new, professional theatres was established, while amateur theatricals also received support, becoming a polygon for alternative and avant-garde performances, particularly with the founding of the Experimental Student Theatre.
Festivals with there tradition of performing using local monuments as a natural setting, like the Dubrovnik Summer Festival (launched in 1950) and the Split Festival (launched in 1954), with their international flavour, contributed to the affirmation of the national theatre abroad.

	In 1954, the Gavella Drama Theatre began operating.
This marked the beginning of pluralism on the national cultural scene, which became evident in repertoire, staging, and other organisational aspects.
New stages (Teatar & TD in Zagreb), followed by a series of independent, or rather amateur groups which promote a wide range of theatrical forms (Teatar u gostima, Histrioni, Pozdravi, Coccolemocco, Kugla-glumište, Montažstroj), along with specialised theatres for particular genres and purposes (Zagreb Puppet Theatre, Zagreb Youth Theatre, Komedija, Kerempuh Satirical Theatre) and festival competitions, of which the most important are the Fadil Hadžić Days of Satire (Zagreb) Marul’s Days (Split), the Small Scene Theatre Festival (Rijeka), the Children’s Festival (Šibenik), PIF (an international puppet festival in Zagreb), and Eurokaz (a festival of avant-garde and experimental theatre in Zagreb), have enabled the realisation of a multi-faceted repertoire with a variety of interpretative polymorphisms as the basic characteristics of modern Croatian theatre.
Ulysses Theatre, founded in 2001, also holds a popular place on the theatrical scene, as it seeks to combine great works of world drama with the unique setting of the island of Mali Brijun.
Ballet

	The beginnings of the Croatian ballet tradition were linked to the mid 19th century Zagreb theatre, but the arrival of a Russian ballerina, teacher and choreographer, Margarita Froman, in 1921, ushered in a new period of development.
A plethora of excellent dancers and choreographers emerged from her school, among whom were Mia Čorak-Slavenska, Ana Roje, Oskar Harmoš and Sonja Kastl.
The School of Classical Ballet was founded in Zagreb in 1949.
The art of ballet was celebrated in the second half of the 20th century by Vesna Butorac-Blaće, Irena Pasarić, Almira Osmanović, Dinko Bogdanić andTomislav Petranović, and particularly by Milko Šparemblek, who danced in the Maurice Béjart Ballet du XXe Siècle ensemble and was Director of the Metropolitan Ballet in New York, the Gulbenkian Ballet in Lisbon and the Lyon Ballet.

	Modern dance in Croatia was cultivated in parallel with the emergence of different trends in Europe.
From the late 1920s, the following were active in Zagreb: Mercedes Goritz-Pavelić, a student of Mary Wigman and Gertrud Bodenwieser in Vienna and Munich, Mirjana Dragana Janaček, who established her school on the dance expressions of Isadora Duncan, and Ana Maletić, a disciple of the Rudolf Laban school, whose Rhythm and Dance School (1945) still bears her name today.
These schools have produced generations of dancers, among whom are some of the founders or members of the best known modern dance ensembles – the Modern Dance Studio, the Chamber Ensemble of Free Dance and the Zagreb Dance Ensemble.
The dance scene today is very active, with a major role being played by the international festival Modern Dance Week, which has been organised in Zagreb since 1984.

Končar now has about 4,000 employees.
Its annual turnover is approximately €320 million, of which more than half is made through export.

	In 2012, the top 1,000 Croatian companies made HRK 428 billion (EUR 57 billion) in revenue, while at the same time they earned HRK 17 billion (EUR 2.3 billion) profit.
The total exports of the 1,000 largest Croatian companies amounted to HRK 78 billion (EUR 10.4 billion), an increase of 2.2% compared to 2011.
With a total of HRK 27.5 billion (EUR 3.7 billion), the largest turnover in 2012 was achieved by INA, the Croatian oil company, followed by HEP, Konzum, Prirodni plin and Hrvatski Telecom.

	In Croatia there are several large companies under private ownership which play a significant role in foreign trade.
Some of them are significant technological innovators.

Life expectancy in Croatia is 80 years for women and 73 years for men.

	With a population density of 76 per km², Croatia is one of the more sparsely populated European countries, along with Norway, Finland, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Ireland and Bulgaria.
In the last 150 years, several factors have influenced population development, of which the most important are continual, sometimes intensive, emigration to European and more distant destinations, two world wars and the Homeland War.
Although the population of Croatia has doubled in the last 150 years, this is low in comparison to other countries (for example, the population of The Netherlands increased three and a half times in the same period).
The population has on the whole increased, with a particularly high rate at the end of the 19th century, when it entered the first phase of demographic transition, marked by high rates of natural change.
However, in the early 20th century emigration increased, and the rate of population growth fell, while the outbreak of the First World War and the Spanish Flu epidemic led to the first actual decrease in the population.
After recovering slightly in the 1920s, war again followed, and there was a second fall in population levels.
The rapid growth of the population from the 1960s to the 1980s was slowed by a decrease in natural change, directly linked to a decrease in the birth rate, accompanied by marked emigration for “temporary work” abroad.
In these circumstances, the population of Croatia went through an accelerated demographic transition.
By the end of the 1980s, a low rate of natural change was noted, which was not at all in line with the rate of economic development.
With such a weakened population base (particularly reproductive), Croatia faced yet another war in the 1990s, followed by an insecure post-war period, the consequence of which was a third drop in population numbers in the 20th century.

	A long period of depopulation has resulted in many negative consequences, such as the reduction of the core population producing new generations, the reduction of the active working population, and the increasing care needs of the older population; in other words, increased economic and social burdens placed on the State Budget in the areas of pension insurance, social and health care of the elderly, etc.
Apart from the decreasing population, the contemporary demographic picture of Croatia is much like those of the other members of the EU.
It is characterised by three processes: ageing, natural depopulation, and spatial polarisation of the population.
Life expectancy has risen to 80 for women and 73 for men, leading to the more rapid ageing of the population.
The average age, which was 30.7 sixty years ago, has risen to 41.7.
Almost one quarter of the population of Croatia today is over 60 years old (24%), while fifty years ago, it was 12%.
In addition, only 15% of the population today is of elementary school age, while in the early 1960s it was 27%.
Natural depopulation is closely related to the process of population ageing, or rather the decrease in the population due to the death rate being higher than the birth rate, and the fall in the average number of children per woman of fertile age (1.5), which puts Croatia side by side with other European countries (with the exception of Iceland, where the rate is 2.15).
This natural change of –2%, like other demographic processes in Croatia, goes back several decades.
The birth rate has been falling constantly since the 1950s, the death rate has been rising since the 1970s, while in the 1990s, when the death rate increased due to war losses, the figures for natural change were also negative.
Population trends, 1857–2011
The age-gender composition of the population to a great extent reflects a typical European process – demographic ageing.
A particular concern is the ageing of the actively working, fertile population.
Natural population trends 1950–2010
Josip Jelačić (1801–59).
This Croatian ban abolished serfdom, founded the Ban’s Council as a sort of independent Croatian government, introduced the Croatian language in schools and offices, helped elevate the Zagreb diocese to the status of an archdiocese, and united Croatia, Slavonia, the Military Border, Rijeka and Međimurje during his tenure.
He has become a symbol of the defence of Croatian statehood and national interests.

	In the Great (Viennese) War (1683–99), large parts of Croatia and Slavonia were liberated from Ottoman rule and the border of the Dubrovnik Republic was finally determined.
The Venetian Republic, which had established itself in Dalmatia, also participated in this war.
During the 18th century, Croatia was divided between the Habsburg Monarchy and the Venetian Republic.
In addition, Croatia with Slavonia, which was part of the Habsburg lands, was divided into the part governed by the ban, which belonged to the Hungarian part of the monarchy administratively, and the Military Border (Krajina), which was administered from Vienna.
The area under Venetian rule was divided into the provinces of Dalmatia and Istria.

	Pragmatic sanctions.
The legal act of the Croatian Sabor of 1712, by which it was accepted that the right to rule the Habsburg dynasty could pass to the female line (Maria Theresa).
It is singled out as an element of Croatian state law that belongs among the most important acts of the institutions of Croatian governments from the 19th century onwards.
For a short time, during Napoleon’s conquests in the early 19th century, parts of the Croatian lands were united within the province of Illyria, when the Venetian and Dubrovnik Republics ceased to exist.
The French administration tried to improve economic and cultural circumstances, while administration and education began to be modernised, so that, to a certain extent, revolutionary ideas filtered down to Croatia.

	The fact that Croatia still lacked territorial integrity remained a source of ongoing dissatisfaction.
As a result, in the early 19th century, a national, political and cultural movement emerged, known as the Illyrian Movement, a part of the Croatian National Revival.
Its chief bearers were members of the new citizen class, and its most eminent representative was Ljudevit Gaj (1809–72).
In cultural terms, their programme involved the creation of a unified orthography and the introduction of a common literary language.
In political terms, they sought the unification of Croatia, Slavonia, Dalmatia, Rijeka, the Military Border, Bosnia and the Slovene lands into one state, which would form a unit with Hungary and be part of the Habsburg Monarchy.

	The politics of revival in Croatia reached full expression during the 1848–49 revolution.
Josip Jelačić was installed as the ban and also appointed commandant of the Military Border and regent of Rijeka and Dalmatia.
During his tenure, most of the Croatian lands were united, after centuries of division.
The unification was only temporary, however, as Vienna introduced a regime of absolutism in 1849, restricting Croatian autonomy.
Although absolutism was abolished in 1866, instead of returning autonomy to Croatia, Vienna concluded the Austro-Hungarian Settlement with Pest.
Against Croatian interests, Istria and Dalmatia were annexed to Austria, while Croatia was attached to the Hungarian part of the newly established Austro-Hungarian Monarchy.
In these circumstances, the Croatian-Hungarian Settlement was also concluded which, although in fact affirming the autonomy of the Croatian lands, did not allow for their unification within the framework of the Dual Monarchy.
Thus, other solutions were sought, particularly after Austro-Hungary occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878.
The case for the unification of the South Slavic lands was pressed by Bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer and the historian Franjo Rački, while Ante Starčević and Eugen Kvaternik advocated Croatian independence and in 1871 attempted to incite an uprising in favour of secession from Austro-Hungary.

	At this time, the first Serbian parties emerged, initially as allies of the ruling Hungarians, then of the Kingdom of Serbia.
On the eve of and during the First World War, two differing concepts regarding unification and a Yugoslav state became prominent.
Croatian politicians, particularly Frano Supilo and Ante Trumbić, who were active as emigrants, sought a federation of equal nations within which Croatian statehood would be preserved.
The Serbian government attempted to take advantage of the war to create a Greater Serbia, which would incorporate sizeable parts of Croatia and the whole of Bosnia and Herzegovina, or favoured the creation of a joint state with Serbian hegemony.

	The Croatian-Hungarian Settlement.
The act by which Croatia and Hungary regulated their mutual public law relations.
The Settlement acknowledged the Croatian nation politically, and in addition to the recognition in principle of territories (with the exception of Rijeka), allowed internal administration, education, religious affairs and the judiciary to be managed autonomously, and the official language to be Croatian.
However, Croatia was deprived of financial independence and the ban was subject to the president of the Hungarian government.
During the war (1914–18), Croatia was not directly affected by the fighting, although soldiers from the Croatian lands fought in large numbers in Austro-Hungarian units in the Balkans and on the eastern and Italian fronts (it is estimated that about 137,000 of them perished), so that at the end of the war, Croatia found itself on the side of the vanquished powers, confronted with the territorial ambitions of Italy and Serbia, who had been on the side of the victorious allies during the war.
The Croatian Sabor severed the state bond with Austro-Hungary on 19 October 1918, declared Croatian independence and decided to join the State of the Slovenes, Croats and Serbs.
This new state, however, did not gain international recognition, and on 1 December 1918, in unfavourable circumstances, entered into a bond with the Kingdom of Serbia and the Kingdom of Montenegro.
Josip Jelačić (1801–59), Croatian ban
Session of the Croatian Sabor, 1848 (by Dragutin Weingartner), the first Croatian civil parliament.
It decided on the abolition of serfdom and the organisation of relations with Hungary and Austria.
Croatia in the 18th century
Ivan Mažuranić (1814–90) was a politician and writer; the first Croatian ban (1873–80) who was not a member of the aristocracy.
His reforms (responsibility of the Government to Parliament, the separation of the judiciary and administration, the independence of the judiciary, freedom of the press, the right to hold public gatherings, the foundation of the University of Zagreb, etc.
), in terms of their intensity and significance, were unparallelled in the period up to 1918.
He embellished Ivan Gundulić’s Osman (XIV and XV cantos) and wrote the epic The Death of Smail-aga Čengić.
Josip Juraj Strossmayer (1815–1905) was Bishop of Đakovo.
He was politically active in regard to the unification of the South Slavs.
He founded the Academy of Sciences and Arts and was a patron of cultural institutions.
During the First Vatican Council, he was against defining papal infallibility as a dogma.
Ante Starčević (1823–96) was a politician and founder and leader of the Party of Rights.
He advocated the policy of full national freedom and independence under the motto ‘Not under Vienna, not under Pest, but for a free, independent Croatia’.
Croatia at the end of the 19th century
Ante Trumbić (1864–1938) was a politician.
With Frano Supilo, he was the main bearer of ‘New Direction’ policies from 1903 onwards.
From 1915–18 he was the President of the Émigré Yugoslav Committee, which negotiated with the Serbian government on the unification of the South Slavs.
After the war, he was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and continued to be active in the opposition from 1920 onwards.
Frano Supilo (1870–1917) was a politician and publicist.
He left the Yugoslav Committee after conflicts regarding the centralist concept of South Slav unification in 1916.
The most popular sports in Croatia are football, basketball, handball and water polo.
According to the FIFA rankings in June 2013, the Croatian football team ranks 4th in the world, behind Spain, Germany and Argentina.

	Croatians are a sporting nation; sport is part of the compulsory curriculum in schools at all levels of education.
Many children and young people take part in extracurricular sporting activities, which are also seen as a way of life in recreational terms.
There are about 16,000 sports associations in Croatia.
The most popular sport is football, with almost 1,500 registered clubs and 130,000 participants.
As in most other European countries, sport in Croatia is financed from the State Budget, state and public contributions, sponsorship and membership fees.
The largest sports association is the Croatian Olympic Committee (Hrvatski Olimpijski Odbor – HOO), which was founded in 1991.
About 80 national sports associations operate within the HOO, covering 39 Olympic sports and 41 non-Olympic sports.
Although Croatia has inherited a tradition of sporting competition dating back to Roman times, or medieval knights’ tournaments, the beginnings of organised sport in the country can be traced to the late 19th century, when the first sports associations were founded.
Hrvatski Sokol (Croatian Falcon) was founded in 1874, and soon spread throughout the country, becoming the largest, most popular organisation, promoting modern gymnastics and other branches of sport (cycling, fencing, equestrianism, athletics, skating, tennis, and so on).

	By the early 20th century, there were more and more sportsmen and women in Croatia, and alongside the continuing high numbers of Sokol association members, who were united in 1907 in the Hrvatski Sokolski Savez (Croatian Falcons’ Union), special sports organisations were founded, particularly football organisations, while in 1909 the umbrella organisation Hrvatski Športski Savez (Croatian Sports Association) was established.
The further development of Croatian sport and its rich history have been linked primarily with the Olympian movement, and were organised by Franjo Bučar, starting in 1896, representing a century-long struggle for Croatian sporting independence.
Olympic participants from Croatia competed under the Austrian, Italian and Yugoslav flags, and first competed under the Croatian flag in 1992, at the Winter Olympic Games held in Albertville and the Summer Games held in Barcelona, following the admittance of the Croatian Olympic Committee to the International Olympic Committee.

	Although the first appearances by Croatian competitors signified national identification, their successes turned Croatia into a strong sporting country, and today, they are a recognisable part of the country’s identity and often serve as its best ambassadors.
Along with many medals at international and European championships, Croatia has won 33 Olympic medals: 10 gold (2 in handball, one each in athletics, weightlifting, shooting, water polo, and 4 in downhill skiing), 12 silver medals: two in rowing, one each in athletics, gymnastics, basketball, water polo and swimming, and 5 in downhill skiing) and 11 bronze medals (3 in tennis, 3 in taekwondo, and one each in weightlifting, shooting, rowing, handball and the biathlon).

In 2011–12 there were nearly 153,000 students enrolled in higher education in Croatia, while more than 36,400 completed their second cycle of graduate studies.
In addition, 1,229 graduated as university specialists and 1,072 obtained the title of doctor.

	The beginnings of schools and education in Croatia date back to the 10th century, and up to the 18th century were linked to the Church and priesthood.
Systematic education of the people began during the reign of Maria Theresa, who issued an Edict on the General School Order in 1774, beginning a reform in education with an emphasis on elementary education.
From then on, every place with a parish church was required to open a school, which children aged 7 to 12 attended compulsorily.
In the same year, the first courses to train teachers began in Bjelovar, Petrinja and Karlovac, and the first public teacher training college opened in 1849 in Zagreb.
In 1874, the Croatian Diet issued the first Croatian Education Act, which regulated compulsory five-year education, and instead of German, which had been used up to then, the official language became Croatian.
In 1945, seven-year education became compulsory, and this was increased to eight years in 1958, covering all children aged between 7 and 15.

	The education system today begins in preschool institutions, which include those run by local authorities and private nursery schools (legal persons, religious communities, and others), and institutions which provide preschool programmes and shorter programmes such as libraries, various associations and elementary schools.
Nurseries are responsible for full-day or shorter programmes of education, health care, nutrition and social care, which cover children from the age of six months to when they start school.
In 2010, 58% of pre-school aged children attended them, while over 99% attend in the year before they start school.
Children who are six and a half or over must attend compulsory elementary education, which lasts 8 years.
There is an adult education system for those over the age of 15 who fail to complete elementary education.
Upon completing their elementary education, children may continue optional secondary education which is divided according to curricula into gymnasiums, vocational schools (technical, industrial and craft based) or art schools (music, dance, art).
Gymnasiums provide a comprehensive syllabus which lasts 4 years and includes a final examination, the state matura.
Programmes in vocational and art schools last from one to five years, and usually end with the production of a final assignment, but it is also possible to sit the state matura if pupils have completed four years of secondary education.
Since 2010, state matura results have been the basis for entry to higher education institutions.
Along with secondary education, there are also programmes which prepare people to work in their chosen vocations and adult education programmes.
Elementary and secondary education in state schools is free.

	Higher education is conducted in higher education institutions through university and professional studies.
Higher education institutions are divided into polytechnics, colleges of applied science, faculties and art academies.
All courses were aligned by 2005 with the requirements of the Bologna Process as part of the creation of a European system of higher education.
University studies equip students for work in science and higher education, in the business world, public sector and society.
University studies are organised and implemented at universities which comprise several faculties, and may be at the level of undergraduate, graduate or postgraduate studies.
After completing a three or four-year undergraduate course, students are awarded the title of Bachelor (univ.
bacc.)
and after a further one or two years of graduate studies, the title of Master (mag.).
Postgraduate studies last three years and end with the defence of a doctoral dissertation, after which the academic title of Doctor of Science (dr.
sc.)
or Doctor of Arts (dr.
art.)
is awarded.
Professional studies provide students with the knowledge and skills they will require to work in professional occupations.
Professional studies, which last two to three years, are conducted in colleges of applied science or polytechnics, and may also be conducted in universities.
Upon completion, graduates are awarded the title of Professional Bachelor (bacc.)
with reference to a specialisation.
Polytechnics and colleges of applied science may organise specialist graduate professional studies lasting one or two years for students who have completed professional study courses or undergraduate university courses, and these studies lead to the academic title of Professional Specialist (struč.
spec.)
with reference to a specialisation.
Universities may organise postgraduate specialist studies which last one or two years, which lead to the academic title University Specialist (univ.
spec.)
with reference to a specialisation.
The university has a long tradition in Croatia.
The first university was established in Zadar in 1396, a century before the Dominican order promoted the level of courses to studia generalia with all university rights and privilèges in 1495.
The beginnings of Zagreb University date back to 1669, when King Leopold promoted the Zagreb Jesuit Academy to the level of a university.
The Decree of the Empress Maria Theresa of 1776 ordered the establishment of the Royal Academy of Science, which at first had three faculties: Theology, Law and Philosophy.
The modern University of Zagreb was founded in 1874 and its component faculties were Theology, Law, and Philosophy.
Today, it is the largest university in the country and comprises 29 faculties, 3 academies and university centres.
There are also universities in Dubrovnik, Pula, Rijeka, Osijek, Split and Zadar, and a Catholic University in Zagreb.
Today, 90 public and 32 private higher education institutions are operating in Croatia.
The largest number of students, 67.5%, are enrolled in university courses in faculties.
In the academic year 2011/12, total of 152,857 students were enrolled in higher education institutions, and 36,448 of them graduated.
There were 9,915 students accommodated in student halls of residence.
In the academic year 2010/11, a total of 3,451 students gained doctoral degrees, while 1,762 students enrolled in masters’ or postgraduate specialist studies.
In 2011, 1,072 of them gained their doctoral degrees, and 1,229 graduated as university specialists.
Teaching was carried out in higher education institutions in the academic year 2011/12 by 16,594 teaching staff and associates, among whom there were 8,094 staff with doctoral degrees.
Zagreb Upper Town Gymnasium.
The Jesuits founded the first gymnasium in the building which houses the Upper Town Gymnasium today.
Miroslav Krleža Elementary School.
The oldest Zagreb elementary school was founded in 1830, with three classes for boys, and lessons in Croatian, and has been housed in its present building since 1878.
Chart of the educational system
The Rector’s Building of the University of Zagreb, where the modern university was founded in 1874.
Andrija Štampar (1888–1958) was a doctor and one of the founders of the World Health Organisation.
In 1926 he founded the School for National Health (today the Public Health Institute), with financial support from the Rockefeller Institution.
The School dealt with the prevention and suppression of disease and the education of the general population.
The Rector’s Building of the University of Zadar, the oldest in Croatia (1396).
Miroslav Krleža (1893–1981), one of the most significant authors of Croatian literature in the 20th century and originator of many cultural initiatives based on raising the critical awareness of society, which made his opus one of the central points of reference for the evolution of modern Croatia.

	Croatian medieval literature, unique in being produced in three languages (Latin, Old Slavonic and the vernacular) and three scripts (Roman, Glagolitic and Cyrillic) developed from the 8th to 16th century in the form of poetry, verse dialogue and representations of valuable literary works, mostly based on liturgical and religious themes.
Towards the end of the 15th century, new poetic standards began to be accepted: themes, forms and types which characterised Renaissance literature, in accordance with Italian literary developments.
The basis for this was the literary output of the Croatian Latinists, through whom humanism was introduced.
Outstanding writers included the poets Ilija Crijević (Aelius Lampridius Cervinus) and Jan Panonac (Jannus Pannonius), who had a fine understanding of linguistic and literary traditions.
In the first decades of the 16th century, Croatian literature fitted perfectly in Renaissance European trends, particularly in Dalmatia, where several creative circles formed: in Split (Marko Marulić), Šibenik (Juraj Šižgorić), Dubrovnik (Šiško Menčetić, Džore Držić, Mavro Vetranović, Nikola Nalješković, Marin Držić, Dinko Ranjina, Dominko Zlatarić), Hvar (Hanibal Lucić, Petar Hektorović, Mikša Pelegrinović, Martin Benetović) and Zadar (Petar Zoranić, Barne Karnarutić).
Marko Marulić was there at the inception, selecting many medieval themes, but adapting them in new forms and under the influence of lay ‘modern devotion’ (devotio moderna), creating works like the moralist essay De institutione bene vivendi, and epics like Davidias and Judita, for which he was acclaimed as a prominent representative of European Christian humanism and the Renaissance epic.
Along with the dominant lyrical, Petrarchan expression of the period, Zoranić’s Planine stands apart, the first original Croatian novel, Hektorović’s Ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje, a fishing eclogue written in the form of an epistle, and the dramatic works of Marin Držić, particularly the comedies Novela od Stanca, Dundo Maroje and Skup.

	In the second half of the 16th century, the Renaissance gradually waned.
Protestantism only touched the edges of Croatian literature, although Croatia produced one of the most eminent Protestant writers and ideologues of the day, Matija Vlačić Ilirik, whose Key to Holy Scripture was the most famous biblical lexicon of the time.
Baroque literature of the 17th and early 18th centuries remained centred around Dubrovnik, and the greatest name to appear was Ivan Gundulić (a religious poem, Tears of the Prodigal Son, the pastoral Dubravka and the poem Osman), though Ivan Vunić Vučić (a collection of poetry called Plandovanja), Junije Palmotić (a drama called Pavlimir) and Ignjat Đurđević (a religious poem called Uzdasi Mandeljene pokornice) were also prominent.
During the 18th century Enlightenment, Andrija Kačić Miošić (a book of poetry and verse called Razgovor ugodni naroda slovinskoga) and Matija Antun Reljković (the poem Satir iliti divji čovik) led the field.
The revivalist Illyrian Movement, headed by Ljudevit Gaj in the first half of the 19th century powerfully affected political and cultural life.
The most important factor for Croatian literature at that time was the creation of a uniform Croatian language, laying the foundations for the continuity of creativity.
Political circumstances meant its basic characteristic was a nationalist component, and eminent writers included Ivan Mažuranić (the poem Smrt Smail-age Čengića), Stanko Vraz (a collection of poems entitled Đulabije) and Petar Preradović .
The transition from Romanticism to Realism was reflected most clearly in the works of August Šenoa (the novels Seljačka buna and Zlatarovo zlato), which influenced the cultural life of the age to such an extent that the period 1865–81 is called the Age of Šenoa.

	The realist period was important for the overall shaping of Croatian literature, as writers and themes from all Croatian regions were represented.
It was also the golden age of the novel, represented by Ante Kovačić (U registraturi), Ksaver Šandor Gjalski (U noći), Josip Kozarac (Mrtvi kapitali), and Vjenceslav Novak, nicknamed the ‘Croatian Balzac’ (Posljednji Stipančići).
Silvije Strahimir Kranjčević (Trzaji) was the greatest poet of the 19th century and a bridge towards the Modern era in poetry, as the stylistically heterogeneous period at the turn of the 20th century was named, drawing its basic aesthetic views and stimuli from Central European literary centres and French literature.
Alongside the poetry of Milan Begović (Knjiga Boccadoro – his prose belongs to the period between the two World Wars), Antun Gustav Matoš and Vladimir Vidrić, the dialect poetry of Dragutin Domjanić, Fran Galović and Vladimir Nazor reached anthological proportions.

	The Modern era also gave Croatian literature valuable dramatic contributions, primarily the works of Ivo Vojnović (Dubrovačka trilogija) and Josip Kosor (Požar strasti).
Janko Polić Kamov stood out as an avant-gardist before the actual arrival of the avant-garde, an innovator in terms of themes, ideas and linguistic style, who in the decades which followed achieved the status of a legend.
The works of Ivana Brlić-Mažuranić (the novel Čudnovate zgode šegrta Hlapića and the collection of stories Priče iz davnine) were translated into over 40 languages (in English they are The Brave Adventures of Lapitch /or the Shoemaker’s Boy/ and Croatian Tales of Long Ago).
She was nominated twice for the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The novels of Marija Jurić Zagorka (Grička vještica) were also translated into many languages and played an important role in the continuity of Croatian historical novels.
Modernism, which in Croatian literary history comes after the Modern era, was expressed mostly in poetry and prose, and particularly in the essayist creations of Matoš and the work of Miroslav Krleža, Antun Branko Šimić, Tin Ujević and others in the 1920s.
It prevailed until the turn of the 1960s and later, with the arrival of generations gathering around different literary magazines, known as the krugovaši, razlogovci, offovci, or who followed various literary streams, such as the borgesovci, etc.
The central role in literary life after the First World War, not only as a result of his writing, but also because of his wider public involvement, was held by Miroslav Krleža, the author of one of the most diverse opuses, in terms of themes and genres, and one of the most copious in terms of output (Balade Petrice Kerempuha, the drama Gospoda Glembajevi, the novel Povratak Filipa Latinovcza, and many essays and memoirs).

	Krleža shares the modernist throne with Tin Ujević, in whose opus the best Croatian and European traditions are reflected (Ojađeno zvono).
Alongside them is A.
B. Šimić (Preobraženja), who is credited with popularising free verse and the finally bringing Croatian poetry into alignment with European literary trends.
The popularity of the poet Dragutin Tadijanović was clear from the great number of editions and translations of his works (Srebrne svirale), while wider circles of readers were attracted to the musical poetry of Dobriša Cesarić, which breathes spontaneity and simplicity (Voćka poslije kiše).

	After the Second World War, several writers gained repute as their literary output characterised the second half of the 20th century.
Petar Šegedin was a representative of intellectual prose in a certain existential, poetic style (the novel Djeca božja).
The opus of Ranko Marinković, a representative of Croatian Modernism, was not large, but in terms of its quality it belongs at the peak of Croatian literature in the later 20th century (the novel Kiklop, the prose collection Ruke).
Marijan Matković was one of the most productive Croatian playwrights and a worthy successor to Krleža (the dramatic cycle Igra oko smrti), while Radovan Ivšić was the most prominent representative of surrealism in Croatian literature (the grotesque farce Kralj Gordogan).
The vast poetic opus of Vesna Parun (Ja koja imam nevinije ruke), the most translated Croatian poetess, forms one of the most important chapters in contemporary Croatian poetry.
The novel Mirisi, zlato i tamjan by Slobodan Novak is regularly cited as one of the best Croatian novels ever written, particularly as an example of existentialist literature.
Some authors left their homeland in the context of political and ideological circumstances after the Second World War, but continued writing abroad (so-called émigré literature) among whom the most prominent were the poets Vinko Nikolić, Viktor Vida and Boris Maruna.
The generation which gathered around the magazine Krugovi in the 1950s (Slobodan Novak, Slavko Mihalić, Ivan Slamnig, Antun Šoljan and others) advocated freedom in writing and aesthetic pluralism, confronting the poetics of socialist realism, while adherents of the magazine Razlog in the 1960s strove for intellectual and theoretically aware poetic utterance and hermeticism (Danijel Dragojević, Zvonimir Mrkonjić, Nikica Petrak, Tonči Petrasov Marović, etc.).
The last three decades of the 20th century were marked by pluralistic expressions in the postmodernism literature.
Prose appeared linked to Jorge Luis Borges, producing a generation of so-called Fantasists (Pavo Pavličić, Goran Tribuson), so-called Jeans Prose (Alojz Majetić, Zvonimir Majdak) as well as new-historian novel (Ivan Aralica, Nedjeljko Fabrio).
In the 1980s, the magazine Quorum gathered together a large number of younger authors (Damir Miloš, Delimir Rešicki, Branko Čegec, Anka Žagar) and stimulated intermediality.
The 1990s produced exiled writers whose work attracted international attention.
The prose writer and essayist Dubravka Ugrešić has won several reputed international awards for her work, in which exile is one of the crucial literary themes (Ministarstvo boli).
The novels and essays of Slavenka Drakulić, characterised by a high degree of feminism and political involvement, have run into hundreds of editions worldwide (Kao da me nema).
The plays of Slobodan Šnajder are mostly performed in German-speaking countries (Utjeha sjevernih mora).
Ivo Brešan has achieved international success with his plays (Nečastivi na filozofskom fakultetu) as well as Miro Gavran (Čehov je Tolstoju rekao zbogom).
Among the generation of Croatian prose writers who emerged in the 1990s, one of the most esteemed is Miljenko Jergović (Sarajevski Marlboro).
The literary scene in the “noughties” has been marked by a series of new prose writers, poets, playwrights and authors whose work appears in New Media, partly because of the crisis in publishing.
Marko Marulić (1450–1524), the most significant Croatian writer of the 15th and 16th centuries; his Latin moralist tract De institutione bene vivendi per exempla sanctorum (‘On the institution of living well according the examples of the saints’) brought him worldwide fame and his Judita, the first artistic epic in Croatian literature, written in Croatian, earned him the title ‘father of Croatian literature’.
Marin Držić (1508–67), a skilled playwright, whose opus on the margins of his time became part of the Croatian literary canon through the force of its original artistic truth.
Among the better known works in the opus of Ivan Gundulić (1589–1638) is the ending of the pastorale Dubravka, a famous hymn to liberty, which is performed at the opening of the Dubrovnik Summer Festival.
Antun Gustav Matoš (1873–1914), a prominent representative of the Modern period; he wrote artistic lyric poetry modelled on the European Symbolists; in his novellas he united lyricism, fantasy, irony and the bizarre; as a critic (Impressionist) and polemicist he characterised the period 1908–14; he was also a noted travel writer.
The Dubrovnik Trilogy, by the most versatile drama writer of the Modern period, Ivo Vojnović (1857–1929), is an anthological triptych on the historic fall of the Dubrovnik Republic and the demise of the landed gentry.
A collection of Kajkavian poems by Miroslav Krleža, The Ballads of Petrica Kerempuh, dealing with human suffering, death and danger, was a masterpiece not only for the author, but in terms of Croatian literature in general.
The collection Hrvatska mlada lirika, published in 1914 in Zagreb, introduced Ivo Andrić (1892–1975), who went on to win the Nobel Prize for Literature (1961).
Although he later wrote within Serbian literary circles, his literary beginnings, themes and influence on Croatian prose were of exceptional importance to Croatian culture.
Miroslav Krleža (1893–1981), the author of the most significant Croatian literature of the 20th century and originator of many cultural initiatives based on raising the critical awareness of society, which made his opus one of the central points of reference for the evolution of modern Croatia.
Isušena kaljuža, a novel by Janko Polić Kamov (1886–1910), printed half a century after it was written (1957), is an early representative of the avant-garde stream of consciousness and psychoanalytical novel, in the European context.
Tin Ujević (1891–1955), the most important poetical figure between the two world wars; he developed creatively from the high art of A. G. Matoš to symbolic polysemy, from expressionist revolt to French surrealism, from simultaneism and semantic curiosity to Indian poetry and philosophy.
He translated from many languages.
Ivana Brlić-Mažuranić (1874–1938), one of the most popular writers of children’s literature; she was called the ‘Croatian Andersen’ for her virtuoso narrative skills, and the ‘Croatian Tolkien’ for her ability to bring to life a fantastic, mythological world.
Storia della pornografia, the Italian translation of Povijest pornografije, is one of the novels in which Goran Tribuson (1948) searches for personal and generational identity and reconstructs the pop culture mythology of the 1960s.
Vlaho Bukovac: The Dream of Gundulić (1894).
The arrival in Zagreb of Vlaho Bukovac (1855–1922) in 1893, who had studied in Paris, had a definitive significance for Croatian painting; his open colourism was adopted by several younger artists (the Zagreb School of Colour), forming the artistic wing of the Croatian Modern period, and contributions were also made by other artists, such as Menci Klement Crnčić and Emanual Vidović.

	Works preserved from the oldest stylistic periods bear witness to the continuity of creativity and to the talents of local people, and place the Croatian art and architecture heritage on an equal footing with the main components of world creative output.
The Pre-Romanesque period (second half of the 8th century to the end of the 10th century).
Influenced by the late Classical period, Western European and Byzantine cultural spheres, small Pre-Romanesque churches with different ground plans began to spring up; the most widely distributed types being a central type of structure with vaulted roofs or small cupolas, followed by churches of a longitudinal shape, although several larger churches were also built (Knin, Biograd na Moru and Solin), which have been linked to Croatian rulers and other high-ranking officials.
In terms of carved decorations on stone liturgical furnishings, rich motifs of interlace or wattle with Christian symbols became prominent between the 9th and 11th centuries, while the names of Croatian rulers were recorded on many altar screens (Višeslav, Trpimir, Branimir, Mutimir, Držislav).
Weapons and jewellery discovered in graves were at first of Byzantine provenance, but gradually local master craftsmen imprinted their own characteristics on them.

	The Romanesque Period (11th to mid 13th century.
Romanesque regional variations were expressed in different degrees of development in individual areas (where building and renovation work was carried out intensively on town walls and fortifications, churches, lodges and mansions in Dalmatia and Istria, and to a lesser extent in the northern regions), but also in the diversity of the prevailing external influences (Lombardy, Apulia, Venice, Byzantium), or the stronger presence of local Classical and Pre-Romanesque heritage.
From the second half of the 11th century onwards, triple-naved Romanesque basilicas with apses began to appear in architecture, and almost all the early Christian cathedrals were extended (Krk, Rab, Zadar, Dubrovnik), as were monastery churches (St. Krševan /Chrysogonus/ in Zadar, 1175).
Bell towers are among some of the most monumental creations of Romanesque architecture.
Early Romanesque sculpture reintroduced the human figure in the 11th century (the figure of a Croatian ruler from the baptistery in Split; the altar screen tablets from the Church of St. Nediljica /Domenica/ in Zadar); while from the early 13th century on, a great feeling for plasticity developed, as seen in the wooden doors of Split Cathedral and the magnificent Radovan portal of Trogir Cathedral.
Split Cathedral (13th century) also houses the oldest surviving example in the world of a wooden choir stall.
Only fragments of wall paintings have survived (Ston, Srima, Zadar, Peroj, Dubrovnik).
Illuminated miniatures in codexes were produced in the scriptoria of Dalmatia (Osor, Zadar, Šibenik, Split) and in Zagreb.
A particular place within Romanesque art was held by the goldsmiths’ craft (crosses, reliquaries, mobile altars, crucifixes, etc.
).

	The Gothic Period (13th to late 15th century).
The Gothic period began in Croatia in the 13th century, and its typical, simple elements prevailed until the 16th century (the churches in Lepoglava, St. Mark’s Church in Zagreb).
In Dalmatia, from the later 15th century on, churches were built in the Venetian style, along with town halls, cloisters, city lodges and mansions.
The most important master of the Gothic-Renaissance style was the builder and sculptor Juraj Dalmatinac (born early in the 15th century, died in 1473), who trained in Venice and worked in Italy (Ancona) and the towns of Dalmatia.
As Istrian painting made contact with northern trends, it reached its zenith in the frescoes which can be seen in Pazin, Butoniga and Beram (Vincent of Kastav, late 15th century).

	The Renaissance (mid 15th to 16th century).
Croatia was the first European country to adopt the influences of the Italian Renaissance.
The Italian sculptor and builder Nicholas of Florence brought the early Renaissance style to full maturity in the Chapel of the Blessed John of Trogir in the Cathedral of Trogir, in which he was assisted by Andrija Aleši.
The same chapel shows St. John the Evangelist and St. Thomas, a work by Ivan Duknović who mostly worked in Italy (the sarcophagus with the likeness of Pope Paul II from 1473 in the crypt of the St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome) and in the court of Matija Korvin in Hungary.
While aristocratic summer residences were being built in the Dubrovnik Republic in a particular style which was unique even in European terms, many fortifications were being built in northwest Croatia, from Čakovec to Senj, to form a line of defence against the Ottomans.
Here, the castle-fortress Veliki Tabor (1505) stands out, along with the ideal Renaissance fortress town of Karlovac (1579).

	Art achieved high Renaissance maturity in the works of Nikola Božidarević at the beginning of the 16th century.
At that time, many Croatian artists, nicknamed the Schiavoni, were working in Italy, among whom Juraj Ćulinović, Andrija Medulić and Julije Klović (Guilio Clovio, 1498–1578, during his lifetime called the Michelangelo of miniatures), the sculptor Franjo Vranjanin, creator of fine marble busts, and the architect Lucijan Vranjanin were among the most famous.

	The Baroque period (17th and18th centuries).
The Croatian Baroque style predominated in ecclesiastical architecture (the churches of St. Katharine in Zagreb, St. Mary of the Snows in Belec, St. Mary of Jerusalem in Trški Vrh, St. Vitus in Rijeka, the cathedral and church of St. Blaise in Dubrovnik) and public buildings (the Vojković–Oršić–Rauch mansion in Zagreb, the Patačić mansion in Varaždin, the castles of Gornja Bedekovčina, Daruvar and Ilok, and the Tvrđa fortress in Osijek).
The illusionist frescoes and stucco decorations, altars and sculptures were mostly the work of foreign masters, among whom Ivan Krstitelj Ranger, Franc and Krištof Andrej Jelovšek were the most prominent, while native artists such as Tripo Kokolja and Federiko Benković, who did work in Italy, Austria and Germany, were also acclaimed.

	From the Classical to the Modern period (late 18th to late 19th century).
The main commissioners of Classical architectural buildings were the nobility (the Eltz manor--house in Vukovar, 1790), the Church (Maksimir Park in Zagreb, St. Theresa’s Church in Suhopolje, 1802–07) and the military authorities (the Josephine Barracks in Osijek).
In the first half of the 19th century, the needs of the citizen class were met by the intimate, modest Biedermeier style, while utensils and ornaments were imported or produced in Croatian glassmaking studios, earthenware and furniture workshops.
Biedermeier painting arrived in the 1830s, mostly produced by foreign travelling artists, but Vjekoslav Karas headed the independent Croatian version of the trend.
In the second half of the 19th century, Historicism prevailed (the Neo-Romanesque cathedral in Đakovo, 1866–82, the urbanised, lower town of Zagreb /1887/, and Mirogoj Cemetery and the Crafts School and Museum of Arts and Crafts /1891/).
At the end of the 19th century, architecture for the tourist industry was built on the Kvarner coastline (Hotel Imperijal in Opatija, 1885), and in Dalmatia.
The Secessionist style was applied to typical building in Zagreb, Osijek and Split, in the early sculptures of Ivan Meštrović and on posters and items of applied art in the work of Tomislav Krizman.

	The 20th and 21st centuries.
The ideas of modern, creative freedom and the right to individual artistic expression in architecture were advocated by Viktor Kovačić, while functionalism was represented by Drago Ibler and Stjepan Planić, the leading proponents of the Zagreb school of architecture between the two world wars.
After the Second World War, many architects developed individual modes of expression based on the aesthetic postulates of the Zagreb school, among whom Marijan Haberle and Ivo Vitić stood out.
Post-war architecture included the so-called international style.
Vjenceslav Richter designed the Yugoslav exhibition pavilions in Brussels (1958) and Milan (1964), while Radovan Nikšić and Ninoslav Kučan designed typical structures and interiors executed by the architect Bernardo Bernardi, the author of many hotels and multi-storey industrial buildings.
Postmodern tendencies can be discerned in the work of Zvonimir Krznarić, one of the authors of the Crematorium and the new building for the National University Library in Zagreb.
Nikola Bašić also produced important works, paying particularly attention to architectural and sculptural spatial interventions.

	The arrival in Zagreb of Vlaho Bukovac (1855–1922) in 1893, who had studied in Paris, had a definitive significance for painting; his open colourism was adopted by several younger artists (the Zagreb School of Colour), forming the artistic wing of the Croatian Modern period, and contributions were also made by other artists, such as Menci Klement Crnčić, a plenarist with a pronounced colourist emphasis and the founder of modern Croatian graphics, and Emanual Vidović, Josip Račić, Miroslav Kraljević, Vladimir Bečić and Oskar Herman, who studied in Munich (they formed a group known as the Croatian School – Die Kroatische Schule), and who based their painting on tonal modelling.
The progressive thread in painting (from Cezanne, through Expressionism and Neorealism to Neoclassicism) developed in the opus of Ljubo Babić, the author of various stylistic cycles, Zlatko Šulentić and Marino Tartaglia, painters who introduced the avant-garde into Croatian art, and continued along the lines of Cubism and Postcubism in the works of the Group of Four, pupils of the Prague school, among whom Vilko Gecan and Milivoj Uzelac were most prominent.
The architect and painter Josip Seissel (whose pseudonym was Jo Klek) painted the first abstract painting in 1922.
Members of the left-oriented group Zemlja (1929–35) dealt with social topics; the main ideologue was Krsto Hegedušić, promoter of Naive art, particularly the Hlebine School, which in the mid 20th century attracted international acclaim, particularly for the works of Ivan Generalić, Ivan Rabuzin and Ivan Lacković Croata.

	The first post-war European and American avant-garde tendencies (lyrical abstraction, Art Informel and abstract Expressionism) were first adopted by Edo Murtić and Ferdinand Kulmer.
The EXAT 51 group (1951–56) moved in the direction of geometric abstraction, particularly in the works of its artistic champions Ivan Picelj and Vladimir Kristl.
Julije Knifer was quite close to them, but also faithful to his sole preoccupation – the ‘meander’.
Miljenko Stanić belonged to a circle of post-Surrealist art, while Josip Vaništa leaned towards poetic figuration.
Within the framework of the New Tendency international artistic movement, Miroslav Šutej developed an artistic expression in op-art, playing on the boundaries between art, graphics and sculpture.
Conceptual tendencies appeared between 1966 and 1978; many authors carried out happenings, performances, created installations and experimented in new media.
Many of them (Mladen Stilinović, Sanja Iveković, Mirko Zrinšćak, Željko Kipke, Goran Petercol) began participating in the Biennale in Venice from 1991 on, the Kassel Documenta show, and in other important international art events.
In terms of illustration, book illustration and posters, many painters and professional poster designers developed particular styles from the early 20th century onwards.
In the second half of the century, Boris Ljubičić, Boris Bućan and Mirko Ilić introduced graphic, thematic and iconographic innovations.
The new age of contemporary tapestry began with the monumental works of Jagoda Buić (1930).

	The realistic sculptures of Ivan Rendić heralded the development of modern Croatian sculpture, which was continued through the work of Robert Frangeš-Mihanović and the impressionist inspiration of Branislav Dešković in portraying animals, to the great sculptor Ivan Meštrović (1883–1962), the creator of many sculptures in marble, bronze and wood, and of architectural-sculptural monuments in varying stylistic modes (from the Secession through Rodinism, the Classical, Gothic and Renaissance to Bourdelle and Maillé’s concepts of shape).
Antun Augustinčić and Vanja Radauš were sculptors of psychologically motivated realism and socially oriented aspirations.
The bearers of a new spirit after 1950 were Kosta Angeli Radovani and the abstract sculptors Vojin Bakić, Dušan Džamonja and Ivan Kožarić, the author of a huge, heterogeneous opus.
Aleksandar Srnec created the first lumino kinetic works in the early 1950s.
Branko Ružić and Šime Vulas developed their work, mostly in wood, on the edges of abstraction and figuration.
The works of Zvonimir Lončarić and Marija Ujević-Galetović veered towards elements of pop-art.
The younger generation, while leaning on tradition, seeks new expressions in free abstract forms and ludic associations, as depicted in the sculptures of Peruško Bogdanić and Dalibor Stosić, and the installations of Matko Mijić.

	The development of cartoons in Croatia, as in the rest of the world, was linked to caricatures in satirical papers, and the first Croatian cartoon is considered to be Maks i Maksić, which appeared in 1925 as a direct copy of the work of Wilhelm Busch.
Following a thriving period of serial cartoons in newspapers in the mid 1930s, the golden age of Croatian cartoons arrived: several magazines were published in Zagreb, and newspapers regularly serialised American and Croatian cartoons, with a strong cohort of artists (Andrija Maurović, Walter Neugebauer and Ferdo Bis) and scenographers (Krešimir Kovačić, Franjo Fuis and Norbert Neugebauer).
The same group of authors got together again in the second golden age during the 1950s, when Maurović started drawing in colour (Ukleti brod /The Haunted Ship/, Djevojka sa Sijere /The Girl from the Sierra/, Biser zla /Pearl of Evil/, Čuvaj se senjske ruke /Beware the Hand from Senj/), joined by Neugebauer, Žarko Beker, Zdenko Svirčić, Frano Gotovac, and the most significant new artist, Julio Radilović Jules; scenographers included Zvonimir Furtinger (who with Jules created the classic Croatian cartoon Kroz minula stoljeća /Through past centuries/), Rudi Aljinović and Marcel Čukli.
The comic strip using cartoon caricatures also developed in the work of Jules, Vladimir Delač, Borivoj Dovniković, Ivica Bednjanec, and Otto Reisinger.
An aesthetic turning-point was reached in the so-called third generation of artists, in the mid 1970s, or the Novi Kvadrat group, composed of Mirko Ilić, Igor Kordej, Ninoslav Kunc, Joško Marušić, Krešimir Zimonić and, most importantly, Radovan Devlić (Macchu Pichu, Ćiril i Metod /Cyril and Methodius/).

	Later, Croatian comics continued the graphic trends of Novi Kvadrat (Danijel Žeželj), and the realism of commercial comics (I. Kordej, Edvin Biuković, Esad T. Ribić and Goran Sudžuka), while an original ‘underground’ Croatian comic strip genre also developed (Dubravko Mataković), along with ‘alternative’ comics (Novo hrvatsko podzemlje /New Croatian Underground/, Divlje Oko /Wild Eye/ and Komikaze).
Several Croatian comic strip artists have achieved international careers (Ilić, Kordej, Biuković, Darko Macan, Sudžuka and Ribić).

The reading room in the old National University Library, Zagreb (now the Croatian State Archives).
There are more than 25 million volumes in the 1,800 libraries throughout Croatia, including 2.2 million in the National and University Library.
In 2011 museums and galleries recorded a total of 2.9 million visitors.

	The tradition of collecting and preserving cultural heritage among the Croats is very old; it began with the development of ecclesiastical treasuries and private collections, while the first public museum collection was established in 1750 in Split.
In the 19th century, institutions were founded to collect and exhibit works of art and items of various types of heritage – the national museums in Zadar (1832), Dubrovnik (1872), Osijek (1877) and Zagreb (1866), within whose collections archaeology, natural history, ethnography and history departments were organised, some of which have since grown into separate institutions in their own right.
Specialist museums were founded from the late 19th century onwards, mostly in Zagreb: the Museum of Arts and Crafts (1880), the Old Masters Gallery (1884, based on a donated collection from Bishop Strossmayer), the Modern Gallery (1905) and the City Museum (1907).
The Museum of Croatian Antiquity was founded in Knin in 1893, but was moved after the Second World War to Split, where it was renamed the Museum of Croatian Archaeological Monuments.
In 1925, the year in which one thousand years of the Kingdom of Croatia was celebrated, museums were founded in Požega, Varaždin and Šibenik.
After the Second World War, many civic museums appeared, some of which specialised in preserving regional heritage, for example in Rijeka, Gospić, Poreč, Čakovec and Kutina.
New institutions continued the tradition of art galleries in Dubrovnik (1945), Rijeka (1949), Osijek (1954), and Vukovar (1959).

	In 1954, the Gallery of Contemporary Art opened in Zagreb, today the Museum of Contemporary Art, housed in a new, appropriate building since 2009.
Among memorial museums, one of the most prominent is the Meštrović Gallery in Split, founded in 1954 with a donation of works by the artist himself.
The most important ecclesiastical collections are the Permanent Exhibition of Church Art (1976) in Zadar, the cathedral treasuries in Zagreb, Split and Dubrovnik, and the collections of individual monastic orders.
Newer institutions include the Klovićevi Dvori Gallery in Zagreb (1982), which does not have its own permanent collection, but hosts exhibitions of world and national heritage, the Narona Archaeological Museum (2007) in Vid, near Metković, the Museum of Antique Glass (2009) in Zadar, the Krapina Neanderthal Museum (2010) in Krapina, on the site of the former Museum of Evolution, and the innovative Museum of Broken Relationships (2011) in Zagreb.

	In 2011, there were 281 registered museum and gallery institutions, with a further 171 collections owned by religious communities.
The work of museums and galleries is coordinated by the Museum Documentation Centre, founded in 1955.
Libraries

	The first libraries in Croatia were founded by the Benedictines, and later by other religious orders.
Medieval bishops had libraries, as evidenced by information from the late 14th century on the inventory of books in the library of the Diocese of Zagreb, which even today forms part of the well-known Metropolitan Library.
When Jesuit colleges were founded, libraries were also established in their schools, while during the Renaissance, private libraries were also well known.
During the 19th and 20th centuries, the number of public, school, expert and other libraries grew rapidly.
According to data from 2011, there are 155 separate public libraries with a network of branch libraries in over 300 locations and an inventory of over 9,700,000 volumes.

	The largest are the Zagreb City Library, the Osijek City and University Library, and the city libraries in Rijeka, Karlovac, Split and Zadar.
The largest higher education library is the National University Library in Zagreb, which also fulfils the function of the country’s national library (a copy of any book published must be filed there and it keeps a constantly updated version of the national bibliography).
Today, there are university libraries in Osijek, Pula, Rijeka and Split as well, which also receive copies of new books, as do the general libraries in Dubrovnik and Zadar.
The Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts has its own library, in which valuable manuscripts, incunabula and rare items are housed, and which cooperates with academies and scholarly institutions in Europe and throughout the world.

Services account for about two-thirds of Croatian GDP.
Major industries include shipbuilding, construction, petrochemicals, and food processing.
Most important of all is the tourism industry, with about 10 million foreign visitors per year and accounting for 15% of GDP.
Croatia carries out almost two-thirds of its trade with EU partners (primarily with Italy, Germany, Slovenia and Austria).

	Croatia does not have large quantities of mineral resources.
Coal and other mines (bauxite) were closed in the 1970s and 1980s.
There are significant sources of non-metal minerals, which are used as raw materials in construction (gravel, sand, marl, construction rocks).
Croatia has its own natural energy resources, including oil and gas, and most of all renewable energy sources, such as wind, hydroenergy and solar energy.
It also extracts and processes large quantities of salt from the sea (salt works in Pag and Ston).
Agriculture and fisheries

	In Croatia there is a total of 3.15 million hectares of agricultural land, of which about 2 million is arable land, whilst the remainder consists of pastures, ponds and fish ponds.
The different types of climate, relief and soil make it possible to produce a wide range of agricultural products, from arable and industrial crops, to vineyards, and continental and Mediterranean fruits and vegetables.
Arable farming covers domestic need for cereals and sugar, and most of the demand for industrial crops.
Croatia is a wine-growing country, and both continental and Mediterranean grapes are grown here, some of which are indigenous.
Vineyards cover 58,000 hectares of land, and in 2011 1.4 million hectolitres of wine was produced.

	Istrian olive oils are some of the best and most awarded oils in the world.
Croatia produces about 50,000 hectolitres of olive oil every year.
Livestock is traditionally of lesser importance, but raising cattle, pigs, poultry and sheep is well developed.
Slavonian kulen, Dalmatian and Istrian pršut are world famous and their geographical origin is protected.
Fishing and fish processing are mostly linked to the coastal and island areas of the country.
In 2011, about 78,000 tons of sea fish and about 6,300 tons of freshwater fish were caught or farmed.
Blue fish (sardines, mackerel) are dominant in sea fishing, and about one fifth are white fish and shellfish and molluscs.
In freshwater fishing, the most common fish are carp and trout.
Industry, energy and construction

	Industrial production in Croatia, until the recession, had an important place in total production.
The most prominent forms were manufacturing and the petrochemical industry, and shipbuilding.
Some companies were closed down in the process of transition, or were damaged in the war.
This mostly applies to the textile, leather, metal and timber industries.
There was also significant production in the construction and energy sectors.
Some industries, however, still achieve positive results and are active in foreign trade.
The value of the sales of industrial products in 2011 was HRK 129.8 billion (EUR 17.4 billion), of which HRK 49.1 billion was in exports (EUR 6.6 billion).
According to their total revenues, the leading industrial branches lie the production of food, drinks and tobacco, and these are followed by the chemical and oil industries.
The most common export activities are related to the processing of oil products (11.8%), motor vehicles (11.2%), chemical products (8.3%), food production (8.1%), electrical equipment 7.8%), machinery (6.2%), finished metal products (6.1%), pharmaceutical products (4.8%), clothing (2.9%), and timber and wood products (3.4%).

	The energy sector is mainly based on electricity, gas and oil.
In 2011, a total of 11,264 GWh of electricity was produced.
Almost half of this production came from hydro--electrical power stations, and the remainder from classical power stations.
Some of the production is occasionally exported.
Production of natural gas and oil is not sufficient for domestic needs.
The oil fields in Slavonia and Podravina meet 20–25% of the needs, whilst the production of natural gas covers about 65% of what is required.
Construction, up until the beginning of the recession, was one of the most propulsive sectors, especially in road building, housing and commercial construction, but after 2008 construction projects were reduced significantly.
Services, trade and transport

	Croatia’s road network consists of 29,333 km of categorised roads, of which 1,254 km are motorways.
In view of the area of the country and the size of the population, Croatia is first in Southeast Europe in terms of the length of its motorways.
The first motorway, from Zagreb to Karlovac, was opened in 1972, but the motorway network was completed in particular at the end of the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s.
The international system of so-called E-roads includes more than 2,300 km of Croatian roads.
Most passenger and goods transport are carried by road.
The total length of the railway lines is 2,726 km (36.2% electrified and 9.3% with double tracks).
The most important railway hubs are Zagreb and Vinkovci.

	Along the Croatian coast there are about 350 ports and docks, and the ports of Pula, Rijeka, Zadar, Šibenik, Split, Ploče and Dubrovnik are involved in international trade.
In terms of strategic position and harbour traffic, the Port of Rijeka stands out.
Links between the islands and the coast are maintained by ferries and shipping lines, which also partially link the Croatian coast with Italy.
The most important port in the internal waterways is Vukovar on the River Danube.
The airports included in international traffic are those in Zagreb, Pula, Zadar, Split, Dubrovnik, Osijek, and those on the islands of Brač and Krk (Rijeka).
The Adriatic Oil Line system (JANAF) was built to transport oil and it links the oil terminal in Omišalj on the island of Krk with the Croatian refineries in Rijeka and Sisak, and also has branches towards neighbouring countries.
The total length of the oil pipelines is 759 km, of which 610 km is in Croatia.

	The telecommunications network is completely digital and the most modern in Southeast Europe.
The telecommunications market is liberalised, with several operators in landline and mobile telephony.
A total of 66% of households have internet access, which is below the EU average, but above the level of some individual members.
In foreign trade, Croatia imports almost twice as many products as it exports.
In 2011, products valued at EUR 9.6 billion were exported, whilst EUR 16.2 billion worth of products were imported.
Croatia exports most products to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Austria, Italy, Germany, Slovenia, the United Kingdom, Serbia, Hungary and Russia, and imports most from Italy, Germany, China, Russia, Austria, Azerbaijan and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In the service industries, the greatest share is held by tourism and related services.
In this sector, the highest turnover is achieved by small and medium sized enterprises, but large enterprises still have the most employees.

Rijeka, the largest Croatian port.
It developed into a strong port and industrial centre at the end of the 19th century, due to its natural conditions (depth of the sea) and transport links with the hinterland.

There is a long tradition of grape-growing and wine production in Croatia, as evidenced by recent findings indicating that this activity dates back at least to the Bronze Age and the time of the Illyrians.
Wine production in Croatia has been increasing in recent years and amounted in 2011 to 1.4 million hectolitres, representing an increase of 15% compared to 2005.
About 2,000 Croatian wines benefit from geographical indications.

	There is a long tradition of grape-growing and wine production, spread throughout most parts of the country, and viniculture is a traditional way of life.
In homes and restaurants, local wines are commonly served.
Natural features (climate, soil and topography) have divided the country into two main wine-producing regions, continental and coastal, and in each, there are several wine-growing hills with specific characteristics.
About two-thirds of the wine produced is white, mostly in the continental region, while red wine is dominant in the coastal region.
Wines are categorised by quality as table wines, quality wines and premium quality wines.

	In the continental region, the most widespread variety is Graševina (Italian or Laški Riesling), and the main vineyards are in Baranja and the area around Ilok in the far east of the country, Kutjevo and the Đaković area in central Slavonia, the Varaždin and Međimurje areas in the far north of the country, and the Plešivica Hills near Zagreb.
Notable white wines are Traminac and Pinot White, while the best known red wines are Frankovka and Portugizac, which are drunk while still new.
In Istria, where there is the greatest number of family-run vineyards with their own labels, Istrian Malvazija is the most popular culture among white wines, and Teran among reds.
The most renowned wine from the northern Adriatic islands is the white Žlahtina from the island of Krk.
Typical Dalmatian red wines are produced from Plavac Mali grapes, often called after the place where they are grown (Dingač, or Postup from the Pelješac Peninsula).
There are also notable vineyards on the islands of Hvar, Vis and Korčula.

In Dalmatia, vineyards tend to be enclosed by stone drywalls.
They form part of the unique cultural landscape and are a monument to centuries of human labour.
There are particularly picturesque terraced vineyards in the Primošten area in central Dalmatia.

The Croatian Spring, a political meeting in Zagreb, 1971.
The most prominent leaders of the movement were Savka Dabčević-Kučar (1923–2009) and Miko Tripalo (1926–95).
After 1971, more than 2,000 people were sentenced for participating in the Croatian Spring, and tens of thousands were dismissed from their jobs or demoted.
The work of Matica Hrvatska was suspended and many newspapers and journals were extinguished, such as Hrvatski Tjednik, edited by Vlado Gotovac (1930–2000).
A period known as the ‘Croatian silence’ ensued, which lasted until 1989.

	The unification of the Kingdom of Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia (known from 1929 on as the Kingdom of Yugoslavia) was implemented in opposition to the federal concept advocated by Croatian politicians, and was never ratified by the Croatian Sabor.
In addition, it was implemented by means of political and military repression.
In protests which broke out on 5 December 1918 in Zagreb, there was much bloodshed (the so-called December victims).

	The Croatian Question.
This was the name given to describe the struggle of the Croatian nation for the recognition of national distinction during the inter-war period (1918–41).
After the Constitution was imposed (1921), adopted by an unqualified majority, followed by an open monarchical dictatorship (1929), and the so-called Octroyed Constitution (1931), the Kingdom of Yugoslavia found itself in an ongoing political crisis.
Due to unresolved national, economic and social issues, the country was in a state of political dissatisfaction and tension.
Crisis was reached with the assassination of the Croatian representatives at the National Assembly in 1928, when the Croatian opposition leader, Stjepan Radić, was murdered.
This crisis entrenched more deeply the divisions between Croats and Serbs.

	After the assassination of King Alexander I in Marseilles in 1934, Prince Paul took power.
On his initiative, an agreement was reached between the President of the Yugoslav Government, Dragiša Cvetković, and the political leader of the Croatian people, Vladko Maček.
This agreement established the Banovina of Croatia as a unit with a significant degree of autonomy within the Kingdom; however, this only lasted until the outbreak of the Second World War.
The Second World War (1941–45)

	After the military collapse of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, following the takeover by the Axis powers in April 1941, Croatia found itself, along with Bosnia and Herzegovina, within the newly-established Independent State of Croatia (Nezavisna Država Hrvatska – NDH), declared by the nationalistic group called Ustasha, led by Ante Pavelić, under German and Italian protection.
Prior to this, Maček had refused to declare Croatian independence under the auspices of Germany.
Other parts of Yugoslavia were annexed by the Axis powers, or quisling regimes were established in them.

	Apart from the Ustashas, who, under Nazi orders, introduced racial laws and began to persecute Serbs, Jews and political opponents, the Chetniks, paramilitary Serbian units and members of the defeated army of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, also cooperated with the occupiers.
The Chetniks were active in certain parts of Croatia, and their goal was to build a Greater Serbia on the ruins of the former Yugoslavia, which, along with Serbia, would include the whole of Bosnia and Herzegovina and half of Croatia.

	The Sisak Partisan Detachment.
The first detachment of the People’s Liberation Army of Croatia and one of the first organised anti-fascist formation in occupied Europe was created on 22 June 1941 near Sisak.
Its members were Croatian nationals, which led to the spread of the Partisan movement among the Serbian population.
One of the members of the detachment was Janko Bobetko, who later became a Croatian general and Head of the General Staff of the Croatian Army during the Homeland War (1991–95).
The date on which this detachment was created is marked in Croatia today as Anti-Fascist Struggle Day, in memory of the contribution to the liberation of Europe.
Although attempts were made to portray the NDH as a means to satisfy the age-old yearning of the Croatian nation for an independent state, it was not long before a large number of its citizens, appalled by the German-Italian occupation, by which a large part of Dalmatia had been ceded to the Italians, and by the Ustasha reign of terror and Chetnik atrocities against Croats, Bosnian Muslims and Partisans, joined the resistance anti-Fascist movement led by the Communist Party of Yugoslavia and Josip Broz Tito.
The first Croatian Partisan unit was formed near Sisak on 22 June 1941, and was soon followed by the formation of Partisan units in other parts of the country.
The Croatian Partisans then established the Croatian General Staff under the political leadership of Andrija Hebrang.
After the unsuccessful Partisan uprising in Serbia in 1941, the centre of gravity for the opposition moved to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia.
Major Partisan operations were carried out, in which the majority of participants were soldiers from the Croatian territory.
For example, during the German-Italian offensive on the Neretva and Sutjeska in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1943, more than half of the Partisan soldiers were from Croatia (of the 7,300 who died at Sutjeska, 4,246 were from Croatia).
From 1943 onwards, the Partisan movement was supported by the main Allied forces, who established a military mission at the Supreme Staff of the National Liberation Army, commanded by Tito.
Apart from drawing upon themselves, and ultimately defeating, the significant forces of the German army, the Croatian and other Yugoslav Partisans made a great contribution to the struggle against Fascism by constantly sabotaging railway lines used by the Axis powers to transport the Romanian oil supply.
A total of 1,800 trains were sabotaged, prompting Hitler in 1942 to mobilise an entire division of 75,000 soldiers to guard the lines, although with no great success.

	Thanks to their significant strength, the Croatian Partisans managed to maintain control over large parts of the territory to the point where they could even establish organs of power on the liberated parts of their homeland.
In June 1943, at sessions of representatives of the Croatian Partisans held in Otočac and Plitvice Lakes, the ZAVNOH was founded (National Anti-Fascist Council of the People's Liberation of Croatia), headed by the famous poet Vladimir Nazor, as the highest political representative body of the anti-Fascist movement in Croatia.
Just like a real war government, this body coordinated Partisan military operations and organised economic activities in the free territories.
In the autumn of 1943, a similar body was established in neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina (ZAVNOBiH).
Representatives of both bodies participated in the revival of the Yugoslav state as a democratic federation at the 2nd session of the Anti-Fascist Council of the People's Liberation of Yugoslavia (AVNOJ) on 29 November 1943 in Jajce.
The rulings of that session are considered the foundation act of post-war Yugoslavia.
Pursuant to a ruling by the 2nd session of the AVNOJ, representatives of the ZAVNOH constituted the Federal State of Croatia at the 3rd session in Topusko in May 1944, as one of six Yugoslav federal states, thus reviving the continuity of the Croatian Sabor which had been abolished in 1918.

	Towards the end of 1944, after the liberation of Belgrade and defeat of the Chetniks in Serbia, and the amnesty for deserters from quisling units (up to 15 January 1945), the Partisan movement spread further, but under Tito’s leadership became centralised and ideologically exclusive, while its Croatian component became marginalised.
In this context, the war in the area of Croatia ended in May 1945, with the military defeat of the NDH, the establishment of a centralised Communist regime in Belgrade, and summary justice for the defeated forces, civilians suspected of having collaborated with the Ustasha regime, and all “class” enemies and dissidents, along with members of the German and Austrian minorities.
In the Yugoslav Federation (1945–1990)

	Within the Federal People’s Republic of Yugoslavia (renamed in 1963 the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) Croatia’s present-day borders were set, although its wartime leadership was partly marginalised (Andrija Hebrang), while the rigid Bolshevist tendency was prevalent.
Despite declaring the federal nature of the state’s organisation, the principles of republican statehood and national rights, the Communist powers systematically denied Croatian state individuality, which led towards the end of the 1960s to the Croatian Spring, a cultural and political movement led partly by the Croatian Communist League and partly by cultural and scientific activists gathered around Zagreb University and Matica Hrvatske.
This movement for reform demanded recognition and protection of a Croatian standard language, the strengthening of the position of the republic against the federation, the self-management democratisation of society and the introduction of some forms of market economy.

	Although the Yugoslav president, Josip Broz Tito, crushed the movement in late 1971, and politically and judicially persecuted those who had participated in it, in the Constitution of 1974 the Yugoslav republics were acknowledged as the bearers of sovereignty of individual nations and gained greater rights.
This policy devised by Tito  was an expression of the need to maintain equilibrium between the federalist (Croatia and Slovenia) and centralist (Belgrade) powers.
After Tito’s death, some individuals in the leadership of the republics, particularly in Serbia and Montenegro, expressed dissatisfaction with these changes, and openly advocated the reorganisation of Yugoslavia, initially on the basis of a unitarian, centralist Yugoslav state, then in the early 1990s on the basis of the formation of a Greater Serbia.
This provoked resistance in Croatia and Slovenia, which were seeking the reformation of the state along confederal lines.
The conflict between these two concepts came to a head in the first half of 1990 with open aggression on the part of Serbia, Montenegro and the federal army (JNA) against Slovenia (1991), Croatia (1991–95) and Bosnia and Herzegovina (1992–95).
Stjepan Radić (1871–1928) was a politician and founder of the Croatian People’s Peasants’ Party (later the Croatian Peasants’ Party), and the political leader of the Croats after the First World War.
He stood against centralisation and Greater Serbian hegemony, and sought the federal organisation of Yugoslavia.
He died in 1928 as the result of an assassination which was committed during a session of the National Assembly in Belgrade.
Banovina of Croatia 1939
Milan Šufflay (1879–1931), was a Croatian historian.
He was murdered for his criticism of the ruling Yugoslav regime, which provoked Albert Einstein and Heinrich Mann to stage a public protest, calling the worldwide public to protect the Croatian nation from the Yugoslav regime.
Josip Broz Tito (1892–1980), was a Yugoslav politician and statesman, a Croat by nationality.
As General Secretary of the Communist Party during the Second World War, he was the initiator and organiser of the anti-Fascist uprising and struggle in Yugoslavia, and its supreme military commander.
After the war, he became the undisputed leader of the state and party until his death.
The Villefranche-de-Rouergue uprising.
This rebellion in the French town of Villefranche-de-Rouergue was incited by Croatian and Bosnian conscripts to German divisions in September 1943, with the aim of joining the French Resistance.
Although the Nazis brutally crushed the rebellion, Radio London declared Villefranche-de-Rouergue the first town in western Europe to be liberated from Nazi occupation.
In memory of the uprising, there is a memorial park in the town, and a road named Avenue des Croates.
Jasenovac.
During the Second World War, the Ustashas opened concentration and work camps in the territory of the NDH.
The largest among them was Jasenovac, in which according to the list of individual names of the victims, 83,145 prisoners died, most of them Serbs, followed by Roma, Jews and Croatian anti-Fascists.
In 1966 a memorial site was created with a memorial erected in memory of all the victims.

Goli Otok.
The islands of Goli and Sveti Grgur were the site of a Yugoslav labour camp and prison for political dissidents (from 1949), which was turned into a reform home for juvenile delinquents in 1956.
It was closed in 1988.
It remains a symbol of the repression of the Communist regime towards political dissidents.

Tito’s residence on Brijuni was his favourite, where he received many guests.
Apart from its political alignment, Yugoslavia differed from the other countries of Eastern Europe by implementing a open border policy, which favoured the development of tourism in Croatia, and allowed its citizens to move freely and travel.
Croatian Spring.
Savka Dabčević-Kučar (1923–2009) speaking at a political meeting in Zagreb, 1971.
The Croatian Parliament, proclaiming the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia, 22 December 1990, which replaced the previous Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Croatia.
According to its Constitution, Croatia is defined as a sovereign, indivisible, democratic and social state that guarantees human rights and the equality of all its citizens.

	The Croatian Parliament adopted the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia on 22 December 1990.
It is popularly known as the ‘Christmas Constitution’.
Parliament adopted amendments to the Constitution in 1997, 2000, 2001 and 2010.
The Constitution of the Republic of Croatia comprises several types of legal norms which determine the historical foundation of the state and prescribe and protect the basic rights and duties of its citizens and governmental institutions in accordance with liberal, democratic and social values.
In terms of the range and number of its articles, it is one of the shortest European constitutions.
The original grounds of the Constitution cite documents regarding the historical foundations and continuity of the statehood and sovereignty of the Croatian state since the Croatian principalities of the 7th century, to the decision of the National Anti-Fascist Council for the People’s Liberation of Croatia in 1943, then the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Croatia in 1947, to the constitutions of the Socialist Republic of Croatia (1963–90).
The basic provisions determine Croatia to be a unitary, democratic and social state.
The sovereignty of the Republic of Croatia is inalienable, indivisible and non-transferable.
Freedom, equal rights, national equality and gender equality, love of peace, social justice, respect for human rights, the inviolability of ownership, conservation of nature and the environment, the rule of law and a democratic, multiparty system are the highest values of the constitutional order.
According to norms which regulate the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, everyone enjoys all rights and freedoms, regardless of race, colour, gender, language, religion, political or other belief, national or social origin, property, birth, education, social status or other characteristics.
All are equal before the law, while members of national minorities are guaranteed the freedom to express their nationality, the freedom to use their language and script, and cultural autonomy.
Furthermore, freedom of thought and expression, the freedom of conscience and religion, and the freedom to manifest religion or other convictions are all guaranteed, while all religious communities are equal before the law and separate from the state.
Croatian citizens have universal and equal suffrage when they reach 18 years of age.
The right of ownership is guaranteed and free enterprise and free markets form the basis of the economic system.
Everyone has the right to work and freedom of work and the right to health care.
According to the norms which regulate the organisation of state powers, the sphere of the Croatian Parliament is determined as the legislative power; the Government and the President of the Republic as the executive power; then come the judicial power and the scope of work of the State Attorney’s Office.
The Constitution also determines the position of the Constitutional Court, the administrative division of the state into regional (counties) and local (towns and municipalities) self-government and determines relations with other states.

	As well as in the Republic of Croatia, Croatian nationals live as native residents of neighbouring and other geographically close countries.
The largest number (about 500,000 – 760,000 according to the 1991 census) live in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where they are indigenous, and along with Bosniacs and Serbs, form one of the country’s three constituent peoples.
They form the majority in parts of northern, southwestern and central Bosnia, while western Herzegovina is one of the most homogenous Croatian regions anywhere outside Croatia.

	The second largest Croatian ethnic community is in the Serbian province of Vojvodina.
Croats are particularly numerous in Subotica and the surrounding area, and in Sombor and Novi Sad.
According to the population census of 2011, there were 58,000 Croatians living in Serbia, but since some inhabitants declared themselves to be members of a regional, subethnic group (for example Bunjevci or Šokci), the number of Croats may be as high as 100,000.
In Montenegro, the Croatian ethnic community is centred in the Bay of Kotor.
There are Croatian ethnic communities in the villages of Janjevo and Letnica.
There are about 40,000 Croats living in Slovenia, mostly in the larger towns and along the border with Croatia.
In other countries close to Croatia, the best known Croatian community is in the Austrian Federal State of Burgenland (Gradišće, where about 50,000 Croats live).
They are the descendants of 16th century Croatian émigrés.
The Burgenland Croats were granted special rights by Austria in a state agreement in 1955.
Croats in the neighbouring parts of Slovakia (4,000) and Hungary (50,000) belong to the same ethnic subgroup.
In Hungary, Croats have settled along the Hungarian-Croatian border and in the towns of Pečuh, Mohač and Baja.
In Italy there is a small Croatian enclave (3,000) in the province of Molisa, while there are 7,000 Croats inhabiting several villages in Banat.
All these Croatian minorities are relics of larger communities, which have today to a great extent been assimilated, so that figures regarding the numbers of Croats and their descendants can only be approximated.
The Humačka Ploča (Humac Tablet), one of the oldest (probably 12th century) written monuments in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
It is written in Croatian, using the Croatian Cyrillic script (Bosančica) and contains some Glagolitic letters.
It is kept in the Franciscan monastery of Humac in Herzegovina.
Subotica, the demographic and cultural centre for Croats in Vojvodina and Serbia.
In the early 20th century, Subotica had about the same number of citizens as today, and more Croats than Zagreb.
About 60% of the population live in urban centres, and one in four live in one of the four largest cities (Zagreb, Split, Rijeka, Osijek).

	Unequal distribution of the population is another important demographic characteristic.
Almost two thirds of the population today live in a little more than one third of the territory of Croatia.
The greatest population concentration is in the City of Zagreb, where 18% of the population of Croatia lives today, and which has exhibited increasing population density for several decades.
The smallest concentration is in the Lika-Senj County, where only 1% of the population lives, and where the population density has been falling for over 30 years.
In general, population density is lowest, and decrease highest, in rural areas and parts of the country with poor transport communications, such as highland areas (Lika, Gorski Kotar), the islands, the Dalmatian hinterland, distant and inaccessible parts of central Croatia and, more recently, Slavonia, particularly after the Homeland War.
Therefore, population density in Croatia today is uneven and patchy.
A relative increase in the population, and thus population density, has been noted around the largest cities, Zagreb, Split and Rijeka, primarily thanks to population growth in their satellite towns, and also in some medium-sized coastal towns in Istria, Kvarner and Dalmatia.
A trend towards seasonal or permanent relocation, particularly by the retired population, from large cities to second homes , particularly on the coast, has also been observed.

	According to ethnic composition, Croatia is a particularly homogenous country; today, Croats make up 90.4% of the population.
The largest national minority is the Serbian minority, representing 4.4% of the population.
The other 21 national minorities have far fewer members.
Serbs have been immigrating to Croatia for a fairly long time, beginning in the 16th century.
They settled in the area of the former Military Border (Lika, Banova, Kordun, parts of northern Dalmatia, eastern and western Slavonia), and later also came to larger towns.
The proportion of Serbs has fallen sharply due to emigration caused by the events of war in the 1990s.
Between 1993 and 2003, some returned to Croatia.
The Bosniacs (formerly known as Muslims) are the third largest ethnic group and constitute 0.7% of the population.
They have mostly settled in towns.
After the Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878, they came in greater numbers, and also after the Second World War (particularly during the 1960s and 1970s, for economic reasons).
The Italian minority (0.4%) mostly lives in Istria and Rijeka, with some in western Slavonia.
Hungarians make up 0.3% of the population, and live in the villages of eastern Slavonia and Baranja, along the border with Hungary.
Slovenes (0.3%) live throughout Croatia, though their numbers are somewhat higher along the Croatian-Slovenian border, in Istria, Rijeka, Opatija, Gorski Kotar, Zagreb and other large towns.
Albanians, who account for 0.4% of the population, settled in the area around Zadar in the 18th century, and after 1945, Albanians from Kosovo also immigrated.
In Croatia today, there are also Roma (0.4%), Czechs (0.2%), Macedonians (0.1%), Montenegrins (0.1%), Slovaks (0.1%) and other minorities.

	The position of national minorities in Croatia is regulated by the Constitutional Act on Human Rights and Freedoms and on the Rights of Ethnic and National Communities or Minorities (2000) and by the Constitutional Act on the Rights of National Minorities (2002).
Among other things, this Act grants national minorities the right to use their own language and script, the right to education in their own languages and script, the right to use their own insignia and emblems, the right to cultural autonomy, the right to practise their own religion, the right to access public media, the right to self-organisation, the right to be represented in representative bodies at national and local levels, and in administrative and judicial bodies, and the right to protection from activities which threaten or may threaten their survival.
The same Act also established the Council for National Minorities and the Advisory Council for National Minorities, the members of which represent national minorities in the Croatian Parliament.
The spatial distribution of Croats by county shows that in all the counties Croats form a significant majority of the population.
In 12 counties, they account for over 90% of the population, and only in two counties does this proportion fall under 80% – in Istria (which with a 68.3% Croatian population is the most heterogeneous in the country), and Vukovar-Srijem County, which has the largest proportion of Serb inhabitants in Croatia (15.5%).
Sisak-Moslavina County also has more than 10% Serbian population, as do Karlovac, Lika-Senj and Šibenik-Knin Counties.
The only county with a significant proportion of those with a declared regional identity is Istria County (12.1%).
In Croatia, as in some other countries, the religious and ethnic compositions of the population match almost completely.
Roman Catholics make up 86.3% of the population, and are mostly Croatian by nationality.
There are far fewer adherents of other religions.
The Orthodox account for 4.4%, mostly Serbs.
There are 1.5% Muslims, 0.3% Protestants, and 0.3% other Christian groups.
Members of other religions, agnostics, atheists or those who have not declared their religious affiliation amount to 7.2% of the population of Croatia.
Croatia is a moderately urbanised country.
Almost 60% of the population lives in towns, and 25% of the population lives in the four largest cities (Zagreb, Split, Rijeka and Osijek).
After the Second World War, intensive industrialisation led to a mass exodus from the villages to the towns, which have developed rapidly, while the villages have lagged behind.
Motovun, in Istria, an example of a hilltop village
Zmajevac, village strings out along the road in Baranja.
The coastal area is characterised by compact settlements all along the shoreline, while in the higher parts, such as Istria, there are hilltop settlements with a long urban tradition.
In the plain areas of Pannonia, villages tend to string out along the road, while in the hilly interior, such as Croatian Zagorje, straggling villages are predominant.
Members of Parliament are elected for four years to a single chamber of Parliament (Sabor), according to the proportional representation system, in 12 constituencies.
In 10 constituencies, 14 representatives are elected, while the diaspora constituency elects up to 14 representatives, and the national minorities’ constituency elects 8.

	The political system of Croatia is based on the principle of the division of power between the legislative, executive and judicial branches.
The Constitution confirms that the people have the power to elect their own representatives by direct election, and the guaranteed right to local and regional self-government.
Croatia is one of the rare states which have implemented two basic electoral models in only two decades, the majority model and the proportional representation model, and combinations of these.
At the first multiparty election held in 1990, representatives were elected in two rounds of majority elections.
Early elections held in 1992 were held according to the combined electoral model.
The early elections of 1995 were also held according to the combined system, but the proportion of majorities and party seats was changed.
In those elections, non-resident Croatian citizens (the diaspora) were allowed to participate for the first time in a separate constituency, which elected 12 representatives.
National minority representatives were elected by a relative majority of votes from among individual candidates.
In the year 2000, elections were held according to the proportional representation system in 10 constituencies.
From 1990 to 2000, two rounds of elections were held for the Chamber of Counties (1993 and 1997) according to the system of proportional representation, in which each county formed an electoral constituency with three mandates, and seats were distributed according to the d’Hondt formula.
According to the current law, representatives are elected to a single chamber of Parliament (Sabor), according to the proportional representation system, in 12 constituencies.
In 10 constituencies, 14 representatives are elected, while the diaspora constituency elects up to 14 representatives, and the national minorities constituency elects 8.
Seats are distributed according to the d’Hondt method and the electoral threshold is 5%.
In the Republic of Croatia, direct presidential elections are held in two rounds of voting; if no candidate secures a simple majority of votes in the first round, the two candidates who secured the highest number of votes go into the second round (run-off election).
Direct elections are also held for municipal and city mayors and county prefects.
Elections to the European Parliament were held for the first time in April 2013.
Political parties

	The first political parties in Croatia emerged in the second half of the 19th century, during the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy.
They were elite parties, such as the National Party, the Unionist Party, the Party of Rights and others, and were primarily concerned with matters of the statehood and political status of Croatia within the Monarchy.
The first modern mass political party was the Croatian Peasants’ Party (HSS), which grew out of the Croatian People’s Peasants’ Party (HPSS), founded by the brothers Antun and Stjepan Radić.
The HSS was the largest Croatian party in the first half of the 20th century, particularly between the two World Wars.
Under the Socialist regime (1945–90), the only party operating was the Croatian Communist Party (later the Croatian League of Communists), which was part of the Yugoslav Communist Party.
In the atmosphere of democratisation in the late 1980s, the Communist League was reformed into the Democratic Change Party, then into the Social Democrat Party of Croatia (SDP).
The first political opposition parties also emerged at this time, among whom were the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) and the Croatian Social Liberal Alliance (HSLS), who fought the first free elections held in 1990 as part of the multiparty Coalition of National Agreement.
At those elections, HDZ won, becoming the dominant party in the period of the establishment of an independent Croatian state and the democratic political order in the 1990s.
The number of parties grew from 1990 to 2000, and today there are 123 political parties registered in Croatia, of which 13 are parliamentary.
The Croatian party system is also characterised by parties representing national minorities, and regional parties representing the interests of particular regions of the country.

	The President of the Republic represents and acts for the Republic of Croatia at home and abroad.

The seat of the Supreme Court, the highest judicial body in the country, which ensures the uniform application of the law and the equality of all citizens.

	Judicial power is exercised by the courts, which are autonomous and independent.
According to the law, bodies of state authority are obliged to protect the Constitution and laws confirmed by the legal order of the Republic of Croatia and to guarantee the uniform application of the law and equal rights and privileges of all before the law.
The courts decide on disputes concerning basic human and civil rights and obligations, the rights and obligations of the state and units of local self-government, and impose criminal and other measures upon perpetrators of criminal offences established by law.
Judges are appointed and relieved of duty, and their disciplinary responsibilities are decided on by the National Judiciary Council, elected by the Parliament from the ranks of eminent judges, lawyers and university legal science professors.

	The judicial system comprises the Supreme Court, county, municipal, misdemeanour and commercial courts, the High Misdemeanour Court, the High Commercial Court and the Administrative Court.
The Supreme Court is the highest court in the Republic of Croatia and ensures the uniform application of the law and the equality of all citizens.
The President of the Supreme Court is elected (for a period of 4 years) and relieved of duty by the Croatian Parliament at the proposal of the President of the Republic, with the prior opinion of the General Session of the Supreme Court and the competent committee of the Croatian Parliament.
The State Attorney’s Office plays a special role in the judicial system of Croatia as an autonomous, independent judicial body authorised and obliged to proceed against perpetrators of criminal offences and other punishable offences, to undertake legal actions to protect the property of the Republic of Croatia, and apply legal remedies to protect the Constitution and the law.
The State Attorney General is appointed for a period of 4 years at the proposal of the Government of the Republic of Croatia.
The Croatian legislative system, in accordance with the legal tradition of continental Europe, also recognises the institution of the Constitutional Court, which is separate from the judicial pyramid.
The Constitutional Court decides on the conformity of law with the Constitution, on the conformity of other regulations with the Constitution and law, and on constitutional claims against individual rulings of state bodies, bodies of units of local and regional self-government and legal persons vested with public authority.
The Constitutional Court monitors constitutionality and legality, resolves jurisdictional disputes between the legislative, executive and judicial branches, decides on the impeachment of the President of the Republic, supervises the constitutionality of the programmes and activities of political parties and supervises the constitutionality and legality of elections, state referenda, etc.
The Constitutional Court of the Republic of Croatian is composed of 13 judges who are elected by the Croatian Parliament for a period of 8 years.
Ombudsman

	The Ombudsman is a commissioner of the Croatian Parliament who promotes and protects the constitutional and legal rights of citizens.
Any person who claims that their constitutional or legal rights and freedoms have been infringed or threatened by the unlawful or irregular work of state bodies, bodies of local and regional self-government and legal persons vested with public authority, may lodge a complaint with the Ombudsman in order for proceedings to be launched.
The Ombudsman is elected by the Croatian Parliament for a period of 8 years.
The Republic of Croatia has a special Ombudsperson for Children, an Ombudsperson for Gender Equality and an Ombudsperson for Persons with Disabilities.

In 2011 there were over 402,000 recipients of social assistance in Croatia, including about 83,000 children.
Croatia has 52 children's homes, 196 retirement homes and 49 special reception centres for people with disabilities.

	Social security in the Republic of Croatia refers to organised protection for vulnerable groups within the population, such as the sick, elderly, those unfit for work, the unemployed, the socially endangered, and families with children, and it is implemented by the state through contributions made on the principle of solidarity.
Social security includes health and pension insurance, unemployment insurance and family benefits, social benefits and child benefits.
Compulsory primary health insurance is administered by the Croatian Institute for Health Insurance (HZZO) and covers the costs of health services prescribed by law.
These include services in the case of workplace injury and profession-related illness, and compensation for loss of pay during sick leave, maternity or paternity leave, and transport costs linked to the use of health services.
Services which are not covered by basic health insurance are borne by the individual, or are covered by additional health insurance.
Pension reform was initiated in 1998, and in 2002, the system of three pension pillars was created: the first pillar is the generational solidarity system, the second pillar is compulsory individual pension insurance, and the third pillar is voluntary pension insurance.
The last two pillars represent individual capitalised savings by the insured person.
The institution charged with the organisation and implementation of the pension insurance system is the Croatian Institute for Pension Insurance (HZMO) and is a public institution.
All those in employment must contribute to the first two pillars of pension insurance, at the rate of 15% and 5% of gross pay.
Today, the greatest number of associations in Croatia is connected with sport (over 10,000), culture (more than 3,600), the economy (over 3,000), technical matters (around 2,800) and social issues (around 1,000).

	The organisation and development of civil society in Croatian history has mostly been associated with the charitable work of the Church and wealthy citizens, while in the Middle Ages, it was also conducted through the formation of endowments and brotherhoods.
During the socialist period, civil activities of this nature did not exist.

	From the early 1990s, civil society began to develop slowly, as citizens gradually became aware of the opportunities and ways in which civil society might function.
The development of civil society was encouraged in the late 1990s, when the Associations Act was passed, while in 2003, the National Foundation for Civil Society Development was established.
Today, the greatest number of associations in Croatia are connected with sport (over 10,000), culture (more than 3,600), the economy (over 3,000), technical matters (around 2,800) and social issues (around 1,000).
There are also health, humanitarian and ecological associations, and those which advocate child, youth and family protection.
Veterans’ associations (and those for the victims of the Homeland War) grew out of the need to exercise specific legal rights and also to preserve the memory of recent events.
They are financed from the State Budget, EU funds, various donations and membership fees.
The best known associations are:
There were 1.22 million households paying a television licence fee in Croatia in 2011.
In 2010, about 7,400 books were published and some 270 newspapers and nearly 2,700 periodicals appeared regularly.

	The first newspaper in Croatia was Ephemerides Zagrabienses, printed in Zagreb in 1771 in Latin, and the first newspaper in Croatian was Kraljski Dalmatin, launched in 1806 in Zadar (it also appeared in Italian).
From 1830 onwards, the numbers of newspapers and readers grew steadily.
The most important were Danica, Narodne novine and Obzor.
From the 1920s to the 1980s the highest circulation was reached, influenced by daily newspapers, of which the most significant were Novosti and Jutarnji list (between the two World Wars), then Vjesnik, Večernji list and Slobodna Dalmacija (in the Socialist period), while from the 1950s onward, professional modern weekly and fortnightly publications such as Vjesnik u srijedu and Start were particularly widely read.
Since the 1990s, printed media have lost their prime ranking in the battle with electronic media (the most important newspapers today are the dailies Jutarnji list and Večernji list and the weekly magazine Globus), and have mostly gone tabloid.

	In 1924, the Zagreb Radio Club was founded, from which Zagreb Radio Station emerged in 1926 (the first radio station in southeast Europe), which has today been succeeded by Croatian Radio.
There are several other national radio networks broadcasting programmes (Otvoreni Radio, Narodni Radio, etc.
), and a host of local stations.
Zagreb Television began broadcasting in 1956 and today, renamed Croatian Television, is a public television company with four channels (with the digital switchover completed in 2010).
RTL and Nova TV also broadcast nationwide, each with two channels, and there are cable and digital specialised channels, along with many local networks.
Television reached record viewing levels and had most influence from the late 1970s to the turn of the century, when it began to encounter competition from an increasing number of internet portals.
The first studio of Zagreb Radio Station
Croatian Radiotelevision, a public radio and television company, which broadcasts on 4 national TV channels, 3 national radio channels and a number of local radio channels.
Vjesnik publishing house was the leading Croatian newspaper publisher in Yugoslavia (as well as the daily newspaper Vjesnik, it also published several weeklies and reviews, such as Arena, Start, Studio and Svijet).
Changing of the guard of honour of the Cravat Regiment parading in Zagreb in the uniform of Croatian cavalrymen of the 17th century who were the initiators of the fashion of wearing the tie, reminding visitors that Croatia is the homeland of the tie.

	The tie (cravat), today an essential fashion accessory for men and women, was named after an item in the uniform of Croatian soldiers during the Thirty Years War.
As part of their uniform, they tied an eye-catching length of fabric around their necks.
The Parisians noted this Croatian custom and adopted it as their own fashion detail, wearing neck ties 'à la croate', now forming the root of the French noun 'la cravate'.
Croatia is still proud of this historical gem, and the Croatian Sabor has declared 18 October Cravat Day.
The Dalmatian dog, also known as the Dalmatinac or Dalmatiner, is the most famous indigenous Croatian canine breed, named after the Croatian historical province of Dalmatia, where it was bred in the past.
There are three strictly protected large beasts in Croatia: the wolf, the brown bear and the lynx.
The olm (Proteus anguinus) is endemic to the Dinaric karst region and is the largest predator in the underground caves, although it can survive ten years without feeding!
It is about a foot long and it spends its whole life in the dark, its eyes being covered with a layer of skin.
Interestingly, it has both external gills and lungs.
The Croatian kuna is the national currency.
The fur of the marten (kuna in Croatian) was a form of currency in the Middle Ages, and in the 13th century the image of a marten began to be seen on coins.
Today the kuna is a stable, convertible currency (ISO code – HRK).
With 13 entries on UNESCO’s Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, Croatia is, with Spain, the European country with the highest number of entries.
Almost 10% of the country is protected within 11 nature parks, 8 national parks and two strict nature reserves.

	According to one theory, the ethnic name Croats has Iranian (Sarmatian) origins.
The theory is based on the etymology of the name Horoathos and ancient writings, of which the oldest are two second-century tablets found at the mouth of the River Don (Tanais).
According to legend, the founder of San Marino in the early 4th century was a stonemason, Marin, from the island of Rab.
Marco Polo, a 13th century Venetian explorer of the Far East, was born on the island of Korčula, according to one claim.
There is no direct evidence for the claim, but research has shown that a Venetian trading family, the Polos, did in fact come from Korčula.
Croatia was for the first time acknowledged in history on 7 June 879, when Pope John VIII granted Duke Branimir the title dux Croatorum.
The Dubrovnik Republic forbade trading in slaves, according to regulations dated 1413 and 1416, while a law was passed in 1466 'against those who sell people'.
The Dubrovnik Republic was divided politically between two aristocratic camps, the Sorbonezi (older noble families) and Salamankezi (newer noble families).
The names, however, have nothing to do with where the Dubrovnik patriarchs sent their sons to study, though they allude to the famous universities of Salamanca and the Sorbonne.
Most of the Dubrovnik nobles studied in Padua, and the names are pure word-play, derived from Italian, but twisted to make them terms of mockery: Salamankezi means 'lacking salt' (i.e.
wits), while Sorbonezi means 'dry as a sorb tree'.
The surname Horvát or Horváth, which literally means 'Croat', is one of the most common surnames in Hungary and among the Hungarian minority in Slovakia.
Of course, not all Hungarians with the surname are of Croatian origin, but the fact that the name is so widespread is an indication of the hundreds of years of connections between Croatia and Hungary and the migration of populations in the past.

	The oldest preserved records of Sabor sessions date back to 1273, although the beginnings of the Sabor are much earlier.
Alongside the Icelandic Althing, formed in 930, and the Parliament of Sicily, established in 1130, the Sabor is therefore one of the oldest Diets in Europe.
Until the 16th century, the Slavonian and Croatian Sabors sat separately, and from 1681, the Sabor of the Kingdom of Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia held sessions.
The official language was Latin, but this was replaced by Croatian in 1847.
The Croats put the Glagolitic script into print in the very earliest period of European printing, in the 15th century, and five incunabula were printed in Glagolitic.
The incunabulum Glagolitic Missal was published on 22 February 1483, in Croatian Church Slavonic, only 28 years after Gutenberg’s Bible.
It is the first ever missal in Europe to have been printed in a non-Latin script.
The Reims Gospel, mostly written in Glagolitic script (1395), is also known as Texte du Sacre, referring to the fact that the kings of France took their coronation oaths on the book.

	The Croatian polymath and humanist, Pavao Skalić, used the word 'encyclopaedia' in its modern meaning as long ago as 1559, in the title of one his works.
The Croatian writer Marko Marulić is credited with the first ever use of the word 'psychology' (in the title of his work Psichiologia de ratione animae humanae), to mean the science of the soul.
Dante Alighieri, in The Divine Comedy (Paradiso, cantata XXXI), mentions a Croat.
A Croatian pilgrim is described as being deeply moved by the imprint of the face of Christ on Veronica’s veil.
It is thought that Dante made reference here to a personal friend, Bishop Anton Kažotić.
An interesting off-spin is that Dante’s great-grandson Niccolo ran an apothecary’s shop in Zagreb in 1399.
A portrait of the Croatian miniaturist Julije Klović, dated 1570, is the earliest surviving portrait by the great Spanish painter and sculptor of Greek origin, El Greco.
It was painted as a token of thanks for the help and recommendations Klović gave the then young, unknown painter.
The Irish writer James Joyce, while searching for work in Europe, found a job in Pula in the autumn of 1904.
He went there with his wife-to-be, Nora Barnacle.
They stayed for four months, during which time Joyce taught English at the Berlitz School for Austro-Hungarian Officers.
The French writer Jules Verne placed his novel Mathias Sandorf, published in 1885, in Istria.
He was attracted by the picturesque gorge of the River Pazinčica, with Kaštel above it.
He was not the only one – this scene has often inspired the imagination.
The Vienna Natural History Museum houses a meteorite which fell to Earth in 1751 in Hraščina, north of Zagreb.
The meteor’s fall was witnessed by a large number of spectators, and an expert report was wiritten about it.
The meteor was nicknamed the 'Zagreb Iron'.
The Italian travel writer Alberto Fortis, compiling Viaggio in Dalmazia (1774), included the Croatian folk ballad Hasanaginica, which Goethe later recast in verse.
Johann Gottfried Herder put it in his Volkslieder, and it was translated by Charles Nodier, Prosper Mérimée, Gérard de Nerval, Walter Scott and Niccolò Tommaseo, Alexander Puškin and others, having a direct impact on European literature (e.g.
the novel Corinne, by Madame de Staël).

	The Croatian mariner, Ivan Visin, was the sixth mariner after Magellan to sail around the world.

Miners from Labin in Istria, supported by the local population, revolted in 1921 and took over the mine, declaring the Republic of Labin.
The revolt was caused primarily by the difficult position and working conditions of the miners, but was sparked by a violent raid by Italian Fascists on the Chamber of Labour in Trieste.
Although the Fascists only came to power in Italy in 1922, the Istrian miners’ revolt is considered to be the first anti-Fascist rising ever.
Among the 1,052 volunteer soldiers from Yugoslavia who fought in the International Brigades on the side of the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War, 528 were Croats.

The hydroelectric plant Jaruga on the Krka River is the oldest hydroelectric plant in Europe and the second oldest in the world.
Indeed, it is primarily thanks to the famous Croatian-born American inventor Nikola Tesla that it was put into service on 28 August 1895, just three days after the first hydroelectric plant in the world on the Niagara Falls was put into service according to his patents.
Andrija Mohorovičić (1857–1936), a geophysicist, discovered the Mohorovičić discontinuity (Moho) in the Earth’s core, which leads to acceleration in the spread of shock waves.
His discovery enabled the epicentres of earthquakes to be located precisely.

The Croats put the Glagolitic script into print in the very earliest period of European printing, in the 15th century, and five incunabula were printed in Glagolitic.
The incunabulum, Glagolitic Missal, was published on 22 February 1483, in Croatian Church Slavonic, only 28 years after Gutenberg’s Bible.
It is the first ever missal in Europe to have been printed in a non-Latin script, and the perfection of the letters and the beauty of the typesetting and printing make it an absolute masterpiece of the printer’s art.
In  their early cultural history, the Croats appear as the “nation of three  scripts”.
Along with Latin, in different variations, they also used two Slavic  scripts, Glagolitic and Cyrillic.
Both appeared in the 9th century  and were linked to the educational activities of the “Solun brothers”, Cyril  (Constantine) and Methodius, who were Greek by origin, but who had learned the  language of their Slav neighbours, which ranged in several related variations  from the southeast to the north of Europe.
Both Slavic scripts were used in the  Croatian region, and were subject to a specific kind of Croatian revision.
The  Croatian form of Cyrillic script was known as hrvatica, arvatica, bosančica,  etc.
It is thought that the earliest recorded writings were in Glagolitic,  although science does not agree on which script is  the older.
From the 16th century on, Cyrillic was increasingly  suppressed in Croatia, while Glagolitic was maintained in certain areas for  religious use up to the 19th century, particularly in the north coastal regions.
Similar to  its position regarding scripts, Croatia was located on the dividing lines  between West and East, the Slav, Romance and German worlds, the border of  Western and Eastern Christianity, then the border between Christianity and  Islam, and finally on the conflagration point of the battle between Communism  and Western democracy.
Croatia has always  gravitated culturally towards the West, although its political paths have often  led in the opposite direction.
All these previously divisive factors, following  the achievement of Croatian state independence, may prove to be bridges to  wider European understanding and cooperation, in which Croatia may find an  active role.
The cultural  relationships between Croatia, Croatians and other European nations and  countries have a long tradition, dating back to the establishment of the first  Croatian duchies.
The later development of individual national cultures led to  the proliferation of such relationships, while today, they are part of European  and world culture, particularly globalised, mass culture.
In the overview which  follows we will attempt to single out some of these cultural relationships,  particularly those which have left deeper traces, though in this sense the  larger European nations and stronger cultural centres which form the European  Union assume a certain priority.
Detail in Croatian Glagolitic of the Reims Gospel (1395), also known as “Texte du Sacre”, upon which the kings of France were wont to swear their coronation oath.
It is kept in the Carnegie Library in Reims (France).
Croatian-European  links in the Carolingian period retained the characteristics of links with  wider western culture overall; the Carolingian Renaissance gave that culture a  general European significance within Croatia too.
The tangible forms of such  links can be seen in preserved examples of Pre-Romanesque church buildings,  which in Croatia, particularly in terms of ornamentation, display interlaced  carved motifs.
The Church of St. Donatus (Donat) in Zadar may be singled out for its  monumentality and other architectural features, modelled on Charlemagne’s  chapel in Aachen.
It is well known that Bishop Donatus of Zadar (after whom the  church was later named) paid a visit to Charlemagne in 805–06.
 Along with  the widely renowned 12th century Croatian theologian and translator  of texts from Arabic into Latin, Herman Dalmatin, and several other  aristocratic scholars, Juraj of Slavonia, a man of humble origins who was a  Glagolitic scholar, received his master’s degree at the Sorbonne in the 14th  century and in 1401 was appointed an emissary of the University to Queen  Elizabeth of Bavaria.
Among those who appeared in France at that time, men from Dubrovnik were particularly  prominent.
The first to study at the Sorbonne was Ivan Stojković (15th  century), while the Latinist Ilija Crijević (Cervinus) was also working in  Paris.
Saro Gučetić negotiated on behalf of the French King Francis I with  Suleiman the Magnificent and was granted the authority to conclude secret  pacts.
The first known translation of a Croatian writer into French was the sonnets of the Petrarchian  Dinko Ranjina, and the translator was Philippe Desportes (1546–1606).
A work by  Benedikt Kotruljević, O trgovini (On  Trade) appeared in  a Venetian edition and was later translated into French and printed in Lyons in  1613.
The most translated Croat was Marko Marulić from Split, with seven editions in French of his Latin  work De Institutione.
Men from Dubrovnik were also active at court and  in French cultural and scientific life.
The most prominent was Ruđer Bošković,  who arrived in France in 1773 when he was appointed Director of Optics for the  French navy.
He became an honorary member of the Academy of Science in 1748.
While Dubrovnik was building diplomatic relations in France, the French  opened a consulate in Dubrovnik.
One consul married a Dubrovnik woman and their  son became the famous Croatian poet Marko Bruerović (Marc Bruère Desrivaux).
The passionate obsession with French literature which caught hold in the city,  along with its particular lifestyle, was dubbed frančezarije.
From the  early 18th century on, 24 plays by Molière were translated,  sometimes with interpolations specific to Dubrovnik.
But the first person to  translate Molière actually came from the north, the Croatian Duke Fran Krsto  Frankapan, who translated George Dandin into the Kajkavian dialect while  waiting his end following his death sentence for conspiracy against the emperor  (1670).
Many new ideas, including the first Masonic lodge in Croatia, spread  from France.
Count Ivan VIII Drašković founded L’amitié de guerre (Military  friendship) lodge in Glina in 1769.
The ideas of the Enlightenment and the French  Revolution became more prevalent, and after the Declaration of  the Rights of Man and of the Citizen(1789), and the  Convention on supporting the oppressed nations of Europe, Jacobin clubs were  formed in Zagreb and Dubrovnik.
In the era of the Napoleonic Illyrian provinces,  cultural links grew stronger, and many French expressions entered the Croatian  language, particularly in administration.
The French writer Charles Nodier took  an interest in Croatian literature and his novel Jean Sbogar (1818),  which was highly successful in France, was inspired by the character of an  Istrian rebel.
Along with the printing of the first newspapers in Croatian (Kraglski Dalmatin, 1806), and the predominantly  Italianate vocabulary of the “Illyrian” language, Šime Starčević, a parish  priest from Lika, wrote the first Croatian handbook for French: Nova  ričoslovica iliričko-franceska (1812).
The Illyrian Movement considered the French to be the  foremost nation in Europe (Adolfo Veber Tkalčević).
The Pole Adam Mickiewicz  popularised Southern Slavic themes at the Collège de France, and his successor,  Cyprien Robert, visited Zagreb, where he met the Croatian politician and  cultural activist Ljudevit Gaj.
Hippolyte Desprez (who spent time in Croatia in  1845) spoke up for Illyrianism (i.e.
the Croatian national cultural and  political revival) in France, through his public activities and book, Les  peuples de l’Autriche et de la Turquie; histoire contemporaine  des Illyriens, des Magyars, des Roumains et des Polonais, which included an introductory study on Croatia and the Illyrian Movement.
In 1861, the  Croatian Sabor began attempts to introduce French into Croatian schools, but  only succeeded in 1876.
A French lectorate was founded at the University, and  respectable French-Croatian dictionaries and grammars were printed.
It became a  tradition to elect prominent French Slavic Studies scholars as external or  honorary members of the Academy of Science, and vice versa.
The Croatian  theatrical expert Slavko Batušić claims that between 1840 and 1940, 553 French  plays were translated and performed.
Among them, in addition to the inevitable  Molière, were works by Pierre Corneille and Jean Racine.
The path was cleared  for a wide acceptance of French literature primarily by the Croatian classicist  August Šenoa, who published several French authors in the newspaper Vijenac.
In addition, Šenoa’s novels began to be published in French in 1879.
It is hard  to list all the literary translations which followed: famous French writers  were translated into Croatian, with Victor Hugo becoming particularly popular,  as a defender of human rights, but there were others who also had an influence  on Croatian writers, particularly Gustave Flaubert and Émile Zola (whose father  was descended from a Venetian/Zadar family).
Vinko Šeringer noted 780 Croatian  words of French origin in his 1889 Dictionary of Foreign  Words (Rječnik  stranih riječi).
At the end  of the 1950s, Zagreb became an interesting European cultural centre, partly  because of the particular political position of the then (non-aligned)  Yugoslavia.
Jean-Paul Sartre visited Zagreb in 1960, meeting Krleža and other  Croatian writers, and appearing before a wider public.
Along with the Musical  Biennale, which for the first time opened its doors to avant-garde music, in  1961 in Zagreb a separate movement in the fine arts, named the New Tendency,  appeared, gathering artistic groups from Western and Eastern Europe, and from France the Grav group.
One of the joint  exhibitions of the New Tendency was held in the Paris Museum of Decorative Arts  in 1964.
In music, Croatia was linked with France by the composer Ivo Malec,  who taught at the Paris Conservatory from 1972 to 1990.
At a time when Croatia was struggling for  international recognition, accompanied by the attempt to present a true account  of the events linked with the collapse of Yugoslavia, French intellectuals  played a crucial role, represented in particular by the cultural and scholarly  efforts of Mirko Dražen Grmek, a native Croat and naturalised Frenchman, and  heir to the legacy of the physiologist Claude Bernard, at the Chair of  Biological History at the École Pratique des Hautes Études (in Croatia,  he was one of the initiators and later the editor-in-chief of the grand Medical Encyclopaedia).
His global  scientific status in the history of the biomedical sciences, his considerable  publications and public activities (along with Marc Gjidara and Neven Šimac,  among others) attracted figures in French culture such as the historian Jacques  Le Goff, the philosophers Alain Finkielkraut and Pascal Bruckner, and the  writer Louise Lambrichs.
Within this setting, and a  wider one, in March 2000 in Paris, the French edition of a large  encyclopaedic work published by the Croatian Academy, Croatia in Europe,  was presented, and the pièce de resistance was the festival Croatie, la voici, which was held from September to December  2012 in Paris and the surrounding towns, and included over 60 cultural and  tourist events presenting Croatian cultural heritage.

Mirko  Dražen Grmek (1924-2000)
Andrija Medulić Schiavone / Andrea Meldolla Schiavone (c. 1510/1515–1563) was an Italian Renaissance painter and etcher, born in present-day Croatia, active mainly in the city of Venice.
Geographical proximity and the gravitation of Italian  regions towards the Adriatic Sea, along with the ecclesiastical and political  tendencies of Croatia towards the West, dictated, in spite of many mutual  prejudices, common connections through the centuries, which were particularly fruitful  in the era of the Venetian Republic, and intensified through Humanism and the  Renaissance, when the civilisational levels of the opposite Adriatic shores  drew closer together.
Early links were noted in the Codex aquileiensis,  a 5th or 6th century codex of the Gospels in Latin,  signed in the margins during the centuries which followed by prominent  pilgrims, among whom were the Croatian dukes Trpimir, Branimir and Braslav,  while Dante Alighieri mentioned a devout Croatian pilgrim in his Divine  Comedy.
His efforts were rewarded by four translations of the entire work  and a further two versions of Hell into Croatian.
As the key  language of international communication and literacy, Latin remained for a long  time the second language of Croatian culture, making Croatia part of the wider  European cultural scene, through the Latinist school.
Later, Italian became the  language not only of culture, but of part of the coastal population, and its  influence was in no way diminished by the strengthening of Austrian power in  the Adriatic after the fall of Napoleon (1815).
Links between northern Croatia  and Italy were somewhat weaker than on  the coast, but were never completely severed, while the Italian influence was  felt via continental routes, particular through Vienna.
From the  earliest contacts, whether religious, commercial, or cultural, education played  an important part in linking the two coastlines, through universities and the  Italian towns.
The most prominent role belonged to the University of Padua  (1222), where many Croatian intellectuals studied; the humanists Jan Panonac (Ianus Pannonius) and Juraj Šižgorić, the  philosophers Juraj Dragišić and Frane Petrić (Franciscus Patricius), the  natural historians Federik Grisogono, Faust Vrančić, Markantun de Dominis and  Marin Getaldić, and others, whose renown and achievements reached European  proportions.
An important role was played by institutions for educating clergy  with, roots in the Croatian lands; the Croatian Papal Institute of St. Jerome  in Rome (1787), the Croatian Institute in Bologna (1553–1781) and the  Illyrian Colleges in Loreto (1580–1860) and  Fermo (1663–1746).
The main  spiritual trends in the Croatian lands (artistic styles, philosophical and  scientific movements) were closely linked with Italian counterparts  (Pre-Romanesque, Romanesque, Renaissance, Baroque, the Reformation and  Counter-Reformation, etc.).
Some of these trends affected national awareness in  Croatia in key ways; modelling itself on the Italians, Croatian as a national  language (instead of Italian and Latin) was raised to a literary level, whether  through a multitude of translations (Marko Marulić, Šiško Menčetić, Marin  Držić, Stijepo Đurđević and others) or through original works in Croatian,  which led to the rapid growth of Croatian literature in the Renaissance and  Baroque periods.
This was particularly evident in Dubrovnik, which, although an  independent republic, had ongoing links with Italy.
Writers in Dubrovnik and  Dalmatia had a wide knowledge of Italian authors, while their poetic models  were Francesco Petrarch (Petrarchism), Pietro Bembo (Bemboism), Jacopo  Sannazaro, Ludovico Ariosto and Torquato Tasso, whose pastorale Aminta was  published in Croatian as Gliubimir by Dominko Zlatarić in Venice in  1580, a year before the Italian original.
The  academies became the centres of cultural life in the 18th century,  communities of educated people who nurtured stylistic simplicity in contrast to  Baroque excesses.
Following the lead of the Accademia degli Arcadi in  Rome (1690), among whose founders were two Croats, Nikola Radulović (who later  became a cardinal) and Stjepan Gradić, the Director of the Vatican Library,  similar institutions were founded in Croatia, as in the rest of Europe, such as  the Accademia degli Oziosi Eruditi in Dubrovnik and the Accademia  degli Incaloriti in Zadar, where Ivan Tanzliger Zanotti, compiler of a  Croatian-Italian-Latin dictionary and translator of Vergil’s Aeneid, was active.
From the 19th century on, Italian influence in Europe  gradually diminished, although the effects of contemporary Italian authors  continued to be marked in Croatian culture and beyond, although its continental  elements became on the whole oriented towards Austrian and German art.
The  proponents of the Croatian Renewal (Petar Preradović and Ivan Mažuranić) found  in Italy an ideal for the unification and independence of their homeland.
At  that time, the writer and philologist Niccolo Tommaseo, born in Šibenik, came  to prominence, as he brought the “Illyrian spirit” to Italy, although he later  parted company with the Illyrians, as he opposed the unification of Dalmatia  and Croatia, even more so the unification of Dalmatia and Italy, which he  maintained should never extend in the north beyond the “arc drawn by the  compass” (i.e.
as far as Istria).
In the 20th century, mutual contacts were  based on the increasing level of translation activity; in Croatia, Italian  classics were translated, while Croatian literature was presented to the  Italian public primarily by authors/translators  such as Ivo Vojnović, Milan Begović and Vladimir Nazor, but also by Italian  experts in Slavic studies, particularly after the foundation of chairs in  Slavic Philology.
Italian writers with dual affinities (Italian and Croatian)  were also occupied with Croatian themes – such as Enzo Bettiza and Fulvio  Tomizza – whose poetry of coexistence and tolerance, the so-called  “Romanticised dialogue” was accepted by writers on both sides of the Adriatic  (Nedjeljko Fabrio, Mario Schiavato, Claudio Ugussi and others), and even by  Silvio Ferrari, the most competent translator of Krleža’s works.
Finally, the  gap between the two coasts was bridged by Predrag Matijević, Professor of  Slavic Studies at La Sapienza in Rome, and the author of the Mediterranean  Breviary, particularly popular in Italy, and translated into many languages.
Contemporary  cultural links have been regularly maintained thanks to national minorities,  mainly the Italian minority in Croatia, but in recent times, also by the  Croatian minority in Italy (the umbrella organisation is the League of Croatian  Communities in Italy, founded in 2001).
On the other hand, open borders have  led to the free flow of information and people, and many personal, cultural and  scientific contacts and exchanges.
Affirmed Croatian Romanists have contributed  greatly to this (Josip Jernej, Pavao Tekavčić, Vojmir Vinja, Žarko Muljačić,  Mate Zorić, Mladen Machiedo, Mirko Tomasović), while the Italian Cultural  Institute in Zagreb (founded in 1942) has kept up regular activities since 1973.
Although the  prevailing characteristic of the influence of Italian culture in Croatia has  mostly been in the area of mutual relations, nonetheless Italian art has found  one of its greatest advocates in Croatia, while the gravitation of Italy  towards Croatia, particularly the coast, has left its mark on the Italians.
Apart from the fact that Croatian writers have participated in Italian cultural  events, several Italian writers have dealt with Croatian themes and concepts  (Dante, Niccolo Machiavelli, T. Tasso and others), as have historians (the  monumental Illyricum sacrum by Filippo Riceputi, Daniele Farlati and  Jacopo Coleti) and printers (up to the late 18th century, Venice was  the centre for publications in Croatian), while travel writers have contributed  to a wider knowledge of the Croatian lands (Benedetto Ramberti, then the  renowned Alberto Fortis, Giovanni Battista Casti, and others).

Portrait of Giorgio Giulio Clovio, pointing to  his Farnese Hours, by El Greco.
Julije Klović (Giorgio Giulio Clovio – Croata; 1498–1578) was an illuminator,  miniaturist, and painter from Croatia, known as 'Michelangelo of  the miniature'.
Links between Croatia and German-speaking countries and their cultures are long-standing and complex.
This is especially due to the fact that for almost 400 years, from the election of Ferdinand I as Croatian king in the 16th century, Croatia was an integral part of the Habsburg, then the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy.
As early as the 9th century, Frankish missionaries left clear traces of a close relationship in the Church in Croatia (Abbot Teudebetus of Nin, Bishop Adelfred of Nin and Gumpertus, a priest from Bijać, near Trogir).
This was reflected in the cult of Frankish saints and ecclesiastical architecture.
At that time, the Saxon Benedictine monk Gottschalk resided at the court of Prince Trpimir, contributing to the expansion of the order in Croatia, about which records have survived.
In the early 13th century, immigrants from German countries (known as hospites), primarily craftsmen and traders, then doctors, apothecaries and officials, participated in founding Croatian towns, mostly in northwest Croatia (Samobor, Varaždin and Križevci), and German weavers were mentioned in Dubrovnik (1420).
Many marriages were contracted with the Croatian aristocracy.
More significant German settlements were established after the Ottoman retreat in the 18th and 19th centuries, particularly in the abandoned areas of eastern Croatia.
The newcomers embraced their new environment as their home, and integrated with the Croatian people, learning their language.
They were well educated and connected with Europe, often adopting teaching, cultural and political roles.
In the 17th century, Pavao Ritter Vitezović, a descendant of an Alsatian family who had settled in the Military Border, propagated in his entire work the Slavic unity and Croatian name.
Bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer, by birth and education an Austrian, eagerly advocated Slavic ideas.
Close links  with Austria had a particular impact on the development of education in  Croatia.
The first gymnasia in Zagreb (1607), Rijeka (1627) and Varaždin (1636)  were founded by Jesuits from the Vienna College (Augustineum), and one of the most valuable,  positive aspects of mutual relations was the Austrian higher education system,  which developed at a time when Croatia had no similar institutions of its own.
Many of the Croatian revivalists, such as Count Janko Drašković, Dimitrije Demeter, Ljudevit Gaj and Stanko  Vraz, completed their university studies in Vienna and Graz.
When the Austrian  education authorities began reforms of the high school and higher education  system in 1849, the positive effects were felt in Croatian gymnasia and  universities.
Due to the  many centuries of legislative, social and cultural links with Austria which we  have already mentioned, up to the mid 20th century, the middle  classes and aristocracy in Croatia were to a large extent bilingual, which is  one reason why German authors were not extensively translated.
Another factor  was the preference for music, theatre and the fine arts over literature in the areas of Croatia which  gravitated towards Austria.
Austrian travelling theatre ensembles were common  sights in northern Croatian towns from the mid 18th century onwards,  while in the early 19th century, the first translations into the  Kajkavian dialect were produced.
German theatre thus favoured the development  of Croatian theatrical and thespian culture.
 The first  direct reflections of German literature among Croatian writers were felt in the  18th century, when writers from Slavonia, influenced by German  writings of the Enlightenment, attempted in their works to re-educate their  fellow countrymen.
Thus Matija Antun Relković produced his Nova slavonska i  nimačka gramatika (New Slavonian and German Grammar, 1767), which became  the basis for later German grammars in Croatian.
His son, Josip Stjepan  Relković, published Kućnik (The Householder), written in popular  decasyllables, which was a sort of practical handbook for the peasantry, based  on a German original.
The Croatian  revivalists were most affected by the poets of freedom, primarily Friedrich  Schiller, though Johann Gottfried Herder also had a strong influence, with his Composition  on the Slavs, published in the first issue of Danica in 1835.
The  Illyrians (Ljudevit Gaj, Antun Mihanović, Antun Nemčić, Stanko Vraz and others)  translated German poetry, and most of them began their literary careers by  writing in German.
The introduction of absolutism and the forced Germanisation  of public and cultural life after the 1848–49 revolution in Austria and Hungary  led to the widespread rejection of German culture and literature.
Croatian  writers began to look for their role models in Slavic, Romance, English or  Scandinavian literature, while continuing to focus the attention of readers on  Romance and Slavic literature.
It was only in exceptional circumstances that  German literature was considered of any worth at all (e.g.
the expressionism of  Rainer Maria Rilke).
German as a foreign language was also affected by the  general atmosphere, and the teaching of other foreign languages, e.g.
French,  was strongly advocated.
The situation eased by the close of the century, so  that in 1897, the first history of German literature was published in Croatian (German Literature up to the Death of  Goethe).
German language journalism continued to be published  in Croatia from 1879 (Kroatischer Korrespondent, Zagreb) to 1929 (Die  Drau, Osijek).
German reviews met the cultural needs, particularly in the  19th century, of the many German speakers and educated Croats in the  country.
The close contacts between German and Croatia in the past are still  evident today in a great number of loan-words in Croatian dialects, some of  which date back to Old High German.
 The  systematic translation of major works of German literature only began after the  Second World War.
The works of Franz Kafka, who had a great influence on  Croatian writers during the 1960s and 1970s, were translated then, along with  contemporary German authors such as Heinrich Boll and Günter Grass.
Apart from  publications in periodicals, the first real literary translations from Croatian  into German were produced only at the end of the 19th century, when  Mažuranić’s epic The Death of Smail-Aga Čengić was translated, followed  by Šenoa’s historical novel, The Goldsmith’s Gold and a collection of  poetry by Petar Preradović.
The novels of Ksaver Šandor Gjalski, published in  the popular Universal Library by Philip Reclam, aroused more interest for Croatian writers, and works by  Antun Gustav Matoš, Milan Begović and Josip Kosor were translated.
The latter two also wrote in German.
Begović  took up theatrical work in Hamburg (1902–12) and Vienna (1912–15), while  Kosor’s play Fire of Passion, written at the urging of Stefan Zweig,  enjoyed considerable success on German and Austrian stages.
The Austrian  humorist Alexander Roda Roda, who grew up near Našice, in Slavonia, popularised  Croatian people and places in his satirical and humorous work.
A generation of  writers with German roots wrote about the expulsion of the German population  from the Danube basin (Schwaben) after the Second World War, while  in recent times, Ludwig Bauer has done the same in his novels, particularly in A Short Chronicle of the Weber Family.
Croatian  authors were translated more intensively from the 1950s on, and the launching  of the magazine Most/Die Brücke in 1966 was extremely well received  in German speaking areas.
It included translated works from different periods  and several issues were dedicated to criticism directed at the current state of  affairs.
Although there was a continuing interest on the part of the German  public for Croatian authors, the 1990s drew  more foreign attention to writers in exile than those established at home:  Irena Vrkljan, Slavenka Drakulić, and in particular Dubravka Ugrešić and  Slobodan Šnajder, whose play The Croatian Faust was better received in  Germany than in Croatia.
The poet Slavko Mihalić has also come to prominence  since publishing a comprehensive anthology of Croatian poetry (Das Schangenhemd des Windes)  in 2004.
A special  place in the promotion of German language and literature in Croatia is held by  the Chair of German Studies at the Faculty of Humanities in Zagreb, which was  founded in 1895, though German Studies actually began earlier, in 1876, through  the German Language Lectorate, only two years after the foundation of the  modern university.
By 1897, the Chair was already placed on a level with other  German speaking universities in Austria-Hungary.
German Studies spread to  Zadar, Osijek and Rijeka, while fruitful cooperation was established with  German experts in German and Slavic Studies.
Zdenko Škreb and Viktor Žmegač  achieved international reputations as interpreters and historians of German  literature.
A project led by Žmegač, in cooperation with leading scholars from  Germany, Austria and Switzerland, carried out between 1978 and 1984, led to the  publication of one of the best known bestsellers on the history of German literature, Geschichte der deutschen Literatur vom 18.
Jahrhundert bis zur Gegenwart.
Promoters of German language and  culture and cultural and scholarly links between Croatia and Austria, and Croatia and Germany, are the Austrian Cultural Forum (founded in 1955,  the year in which the Republic of Austria achieved full state sovereignty, and  one of the oldest Austrian cultural institutions outside Austria) and the Goethe Institute in Zagreb.

Ivan  Zajc (1832–1914), Croatian composer and conductor.
Ruđer Josip Bošković (1711-1787) was a physicist, astronomer, mathematician, philosopher, diplomat, poet, theologian and Jesuit priest from Dubrovnik.
He studied and lived in Italy and France where he also published many of his works.
He produced a precursor of atomic theory and made many contributions to astronomy, including the first geometric procedure for computing the orbit of a planet from three observations of its position.
In 1753 he also discovered the absence of atmosphere on the Moon.
He was the founder of the Brera Observatory in Milan.
He was charged with a diplomatic mission to London on behalf of the Republic of Dubrovnik (1760) and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society during his stay in England (1761).
In the Old English 9th century translation from the Latin by King Alfred of the History of the World by Paulus Orosius, to which the king appended a review of more recent history up to his own day, White Croatia is mentioned, as are the geographical names of Istria and Dalmatia.
In the 12th century, contacts were made through King Richard I (Richard the Lionheart), who was thought to have been shipwrecked in the Adriatic on his return from the Holy Land, and to have spent some time in Dubrovnik.
Both English and Mediterranean chroniclers recorded these events.
British travellers and pilgrims reported from Croatian lands in the 14th century – the best known such description, by Richard Guilford, was printed in 1511.
Thanks to  its well-developed trading network, Dubrovnik held a prominent place in  cultural links with Great Britain.
There were several distinguished scholars  active in the Dubrovnik trading colony in London.
In the 15th  century, Juraj Dragišić taught theology at Oxford, while in the 16th  century, Marin Getaldić, the astronomer and mathematician, joined British  colleagues in significant scientific work.
In the 17th century,  Franjo Biundović from Hvar wrote his History of the English Civil Wars while living in England, for which he was rewarded with an aristocratic title.
The Protestant apologist from Rab, Markantun de Dominis, took up a high  position at the English court; in 1617 he became the  first Croat to receive an honorary doctorate from the University of Cambridge,  and in 1618 he was appointed Dean of Windsor.
Ruđer Bošković, the greatest Croatian scientist, visited England in 1760.
He  lectured at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge and visited the  observatory at Greenwich.
Although his stay was short, he met leading British  scientists and artists and left a deep impression on them, so much so that he  was elected a  member of the Royal  Academy of Science in 1761.
In the 18th  and 19th centuries, interest on the part of the British people in  Croatia increased.
They were particularly fascinated by archaeological  monuments such as Diocletian’s Palace in Split, which was described in detail  by the architect Robert Adam.
More and more articles were published on Croatian  history and folk customs, as part of a growing interest in southeast Europe in  general.
At this time, the first translations of poems appeared, such as the Hasanaginica.
In Croatia,  contacts with English literature date back to the 18th century, when  the first Shakespeare plays were staged, although in German and Italian translations.
It was not  until the time of the Croatian Revival that English literature became better  known, mostly thanks to the efforts of Abbot Ivan Krizmanić of Marija Bistrica.
His translations, although preserved only in manuscript form, are considered  the first direct translations from English into Croatian.
Another person who  had a wide knowledge of English literature and a desire to popularise it was  Stanko Vraz.
More recent Croatian writers extended knowledge of English  literature, among whom Ivan Goran Kovačić made a significant contribution to  the translation of poetry.
The first  chair of Slavic Studies was established in 1890 in Oxford, and lectures by the  first incumbent, William Morfill, who was an associate of Vatroslav Jagić,  formed the basis for studies in South Slavic Literature and Languages,  including Croatian.
A department for Slavic Studies opened in Cambridge in  1900, and was later headed by Robert Auty, the leading British 20th  century Croatian expert, who produced an overview of the development of the  Croatian language in 1979.
Several classic works of Croatian literature were  translated into English, for example Gundulić’s Dubravka and Osman,  Mažuranić’s The Death of Smail-Aga Čengić, Croatian Tales of Long Ago by Ivana Brlić-Mažuranić, Ivo  Vojnović’s Dubrovnik Trilogy and some of Držić’s works.
At the end  of the 19th century, the first English language experts appeared in  Croatia.
Natalija Wickerhauser opened the first English Language School in  Zagreb, Aleksander Lochmer compiled the first English-Croatian dictionary in  Senj in 1906, and launched the  English Lectorate in Zagreb, while Vladoje Dukat emerged as the founder of  English Studies and the author of the first Croatian overview of English  literature.
Since then, work has continued systematically in terms of studying  and translating literary works, and this has gained in range since the end of  the Second World War.
Josip Torbarina, a university professor in Zagreb and  Zadar, reached the zenith of translation skills in this period, in addition to  being a renowned Shakespearian expert and teaching many generations of Croatian  students of English language and literature.
The British Council, which opened  an office in Zagreb in 1946, has made a great contribution to the development and spread of English studies.
Although  English has never been historically present in Croatia in the same way as  German or Italian, since the 1960s it has become the most influential foreign  language, partly due to the effects of popular culture.
In the 20th century, many Croatian artists and scientists  lived in or visited England, including the writer Josip Kosor, who spent the  longest time there, and whose works were translated into English.
In 1915, Ivan  Meštrović exhibited in London and in 1919 a monograph about him was published.
Musicians have also enjoyed considerable success: in 1911, the operetta Baron  Trenk by Srećko Albini was performed, while Milka Trnina appeared many  times at Covent Garden.
The theatre director Vlado Habunek received wide  acclaim for his production of The Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer.
The works of  Croatian artists are housed in British museums, for example miniatures by  Julije Klović, and a list of such works was compiled in 1971 by Vladimir  Markotić.
Branko Franolić presented a Croatian bibliography to the English  public.
Many Croatian scholars and scientists have worked at British  universities, of whom the most prominent is the philosopher Edo Pivčević at  Bristol University, who launched the British-Croatian Review in 1974.
The journalist and publicist Krsto Cviić is particularly credited for  engendering better understanding of political circumstances in Eastern Europe  and the former Yugoslavia.
As Croatia  joins the European Union, a cultural festival entitled Welcome Croatia took place between January and June 2013  in London and other British towns.
The programme included lectures and seminars, as well as drama and musical performances  promoting Croatian culture.
Croatian  writer and humanist Marko Marulić (1450–1524) was known in England among the greatest  scholars and representatives of religious and secular authorities.
His Evangelistarium was even read by King  Henry VIII before his break with the Catholic Church.

Grassalkovich Palace in Bratislava, today the residence of the president of Slovakia, was built in 1760 for Count Antal Grassalkovich, a Croatian noble serving as the head of the Hungarian Chamber.
This palace is the largest and most important Baroque building in Slovakia.

	Apart from its relations with leading European nations and cultures, relations with Central European nations have also been important to Croatia for historical and geographical reasons.
Relations between Croats and certain Central European nations have been defined by two main factors – political (statehood) and ethno-cultural (a common Slavic heritage).
Common state frameworks have formed the most intensive factors in Croatian-Hungarian long-lasting (for over thousands of years) relations, and through them, Croatian-Slovak relations, given the fact that modern Slovakia was also part of the Hungarian Kingdom.
From the 16th century on, the Czechs and some Poles also lived within the bounds of the Habsburg Empire.
Legends linked to ethnic descent, which connect the Croats with Czechs and Poles, have long existed, but it was in the 19th century that the idea of mutual Slavic roots formed the basis for the development of specific cooperation between leading scholars and artists.

	Croatian-Hungarian relations.
Given the enduring close political links between Croatia and Hungary, the Hungarians played a significant role in the cultural formation of continental Croatia, starting in 1094, with the foundation of the Diocese of Zagreb, which for a long time was part of the Esztergom, then the Kalocsa Archdiocese.
Through their mediation, the oldest liturgical codices came to Croatia (Agenda Pontificialis, Benedictionale, Sacramentarium), spreading the cult of the venerated Hungarian royals, Ladislaus, Stephen, Emeric and Elizabeth.
Originally, traces of the oldest literary links between Croatia and Hungary were evident in ecclesiastical and courtly literature, and gained strength in the Humanist period (15th century), during the reign of Matthias Corvinus and his heirs, when Croats were members of Hungarian courts or university circles (Janus Pannonius, the Bishop of Pécs, and Ivan Vitez of Sredna, the tutor of Matthias Corvinus, the sculptors Ivan Duknović and Jakov Statilić, the architect Vinko of Dubrovnik, the miniaturist Julije Klović, and the physician Jakov de Angelis, for example), while the influence of Croatian oral tradition was evident in Hungarian literature and later in the poetry of the Illyrian period (Bálint Balassi).
Mutual relations developed through linguistic influences, migratory trends, common rulers or heroes in the wars against the Ottomans, but particularly through familial relationships among the nobility, who often bore a dual cultural identity.
So, for example, in the 17th century, Petar Zrinski translated in Croatian the poem The Adriatic Sea Siren, which his brother Nikola originally wrote in Hungarian.
Several Croats were installed as leaders in the Kalocsa Archdiocese, and one of them, Adam Patačić, founded the archdiocesan library in the 19th century, which is today a public, scientific library.

	A significant role in cultural relations was played by the Chair of Slavic Studies from 1881 on, and the Chair of Croatian Language and Literature from 1899 to 1939, at the University of Budapest.
The philologist Kazimir Grekša, author of Slovnica mađarskoga jezika (Hungarian Grammar), was associate professor of Hungarian from 1904 to 1918 at the Zagreb Faculty of Humanities, while Ivan Bojničić was the Hungarian lector there from 1882, becoming associate professor from 1910 to 1922.

	A great contribution to the advance of Croatian-Hungarian cultural links in recent times has been made by the Chair of Hungarian Studies, established in 1994 at the Faculty of Humanities of the University of Zagreb.
Croatian-Czech relations.
Croatian-Czech cultural relations can be traced back to the activities of Sts.
Cyril and Methodius, whose disciples spread Old Slavonic worship in the region of present--day Croatia (Žitija Konstantina Ćirila i Metodija), as witnessed by the Glagolitic script used to write the Kijevski listići, the oldest (10th century) Old Slavonic text revised by the Czechs/Moravians, and the Bečki listići, the oldest (11th to 12th century) Old Slavonic liturgical monument to Croatian revision.
The first bishop of the Diocese of Zagreb (1094) was Bishop Duh, a Czech by origin, who brought over many clergy and laid the foundations of Zagreb’s Capitol.

	In the 20th century, there were several professors of Czech origin at the University of Zagreb, for example Gustav Janeček, Fran Smetanka, Emil Prašek and Albert Bazala.
On the other hand, Prague was one of the academic centres for the Croatian intelligentsia of the time, and among others, the soon-to-be prominent politician Stjepan Radić studied at Charles University.
At that time, Prague was a central reference point for Croatian art; Vlaho Bukovac became a professor at the Academy, while Milivoj Uzelac, Vilko Gecan and others became acquainted with expressionist trends.
Croatian-Czech relations continued after the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, i.e.
after the creation of the Republic of Czechoslovakia and the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (Yugoslavia).
Contemporary writers were systematically translated (Jaroslav Hašek, Karel Čapek and Jan Neruda on the one hand, and Tin Ujević and Miroslav Krleža on the other), and their works were performed on Croatian and Czech stages.
Anthologies of Czech literature and poetry were published, and articles on Czech literature written by Ivan Esih and Ljudevit Jonke.

	Croatian-Slovakian relations.
Croatia and Slovakia shared more or less the same destiny under the multinational Hungarian kingdom from the 12th century right up to 1918, under feudal magnates and the aristocracy, whose estates (such as those belonging to the Erdődy, Frankapan and Keglević families) extended throughout Croatian and Slovakian regions following the accession of the Habsburgs to the Croato-Hungarian throne.
Leading Croatian humanists, such as Ivan Vitez of Sredna and Janus Pannonius, played a major role in founding the first Slovak university, the Istropolitana in Bratislava (1467), where several members of the Frankapan family were educated, alongside other Croats.
In the early 17th century, the saint-to-be Marko of Križevci was the principal of the seminary in Trnava, and Esztergom canon and director of the Benedictine abbey of Krásno near Košice.
At this time, Juraj Habdelić, Andrija Jambrešić and others also worked at the Jesuit University of Trnava, educating many Croats engaged in cultural activities, and printing religious books and primers in Croatian.
Meanwhile, the Slovak intellectuals Ján Spišák and Ján Porubský participated in the founding of Jesuit study courses in Zagreb in 1608.

	Mutual contacts did not diminish in intensity after the Second World War, and continued up to recent times, characterised in particular by cooperation in various spheres of artistic and scholarly expression.
Study courses in Slovak language and literature at the Faculty of Humanities in Zagreb have contributed greatly to this, which from 1994 were held within the Departments of Bohemian Studies, Slavic Studies and Croatian Studies, but in 1997/98 became an independent course, while Croatian Studies are available at Comenius University in Bratislava and Matej Bel University in Banska Bistrica.
Prominent individuals, such as the historians Kvetoslava Kučerova or translator expert Jan Jankovič, have contributed to the promotion of Croatian cultural heritage in Slovakia through scholarly studies and translations.
Ludwig Bauer was the author of the first Croatian anthology of Slovak poetry (Crna violina – Black Violin).
In addition, since 2003, a theatre festival dedicated to the works of Miro Gavran has been held in Trnava.
Croatian-Polish relations.
The first Croatian-Polish contacts were linked to the tradition of the ancient homeland of the Croats in White Croatia, in present-day Poland, as recorded in the 10th century by the Byzantine emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus.
These contacts were renewed during the reign of the Croatian-Hungarian King Louis I of Anjou, who was also crowned king of Poland in 1370, and increased when Louis II Jagiellon ascended the Croatian-Hungarian throne in 1516.
At that time, leading Croatian scholars often spent time in Poland (Stjepan Brodarić, brothers Trankvil and Franjo Trankvil Andreis, and also Antun and Mihovil Vrančić), and many Croatian students enrolled at the University of Cracow.
Toma Budislavić was the personal physician of Bishop Petar Myszkowski, whose court was one of the humanist centres of Poland at the time.
Budislavić was later ennobled by King Stjepan Batory and given the title of Royal Physician.
It is assumed that the library he brought back with him on his return to Dubrovnik was used later by Mavro Orbini and Ivan Gundulić (known in Poland as the ‘Illyrian Homer’) to acquaint themselves with Polish matters.
Gundulić celebrated the Polish victory at Khotyn (1621) in his work Osman, while Jerolim Kavanjin and Andrija Kačić Miošić, among others, wrote about the great victory of John Sobieski over the Ottomans near Vienna in 1683.
Closer relations were engendered during the entire period of the Polish elected kings.
Nobles from Dubrovnik and Bay of Kotor resided at the court of the last Polish king, Stanisław II August Poniatowski, who also corresponded with Ruđer Bošković.

	Pope John Paul II, a Pole by birth, displayed particular affection for Croatia on many occasions.
During his pontificate, Croatia achieved independence and welcomed him on three pastoral visits.
In one of his speeches to Croatian pilgrims, he referred to their joint Slavic roots, saying, ‘You speak of White Croatia, your ancient homeland, which is now exactly where my birthplace is.’

The “Golden Gate” was erected between the years 29 and 27 BC by the Sergi family, in honor of three members of the family who held important positions in Pula at that time.
This triumphal arch leaned against the city gate Porta Aurea thus called because of its richly ornamented arch or gilded elements.
The gate and wall were pulled down in the beginning of the 19th century as a result of the city expansion outside the city walls.
The Arch was constructed in Corinthian style with strong Hellenistic and Asia Minor influences both in the method and ornaments.
As the eastern side was not visible it has remained for the most part uncarved, while the western, town side is richly decorated.
Today numerous cultural performances, theatrical and musical, are held on the square next to the Arch.
The adjacent street is a shopping area.

From the upper circular street one of the perpendicular paths leads to the top of the central hill of the city where a star-shaped castle with four bastions was built in 1630.
Wishing to protect the city and its harbor, because of it great significance in maritime trade in the North Adriatic, the Venetians commissioned the building of the Castle from the French military architect Antoine de Ville.
This was most probably the site of an earlier fortress dating from the pre-Roman and Roman period.
The Histrian hill-fort was primarily built for defensive purposes, whereas in the Roman period a small military garrison was stationed here.
Today the Castle houses the Historical Museum of Istria.

The Naval cemetery, dating from 1866, is the site where 150,000 soldiers from the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy (until 1918) were buried.
It is located in the direction of Stoja.

On the northeastern slopes of the central hill of the city, below the Castle are the remains of a Roman theater: in addition to the Amphitheater, Pula had two other theaters during the Roman period.
The larger one, which has not been preserved, was situated outside the city, on the slopes of Zaro hill (Monte Zaro), south of the city walls.
The other theater known as the Small Roman Theater was situated within the city walls.
The remains of scene, semicircular orchestra and tired section for the audience have partly been reconstructed.
Below the theater is the building of the one-time German Royal Gymnasium, which in 1930 became the Archaeological Museum of Istria.
Today the museum displays a rich collection of prehistoric, classical and early medieval monuments found in Istria.

After some modifications in the collection of stone monuments and having displayed the remaining exhibits, in 1949 the museum reopened as the specialized Archaeological Museum of Istria.
By systematic work and with great efforts, after having restituted part of the archaeological objects from Italy in 1961, the museum building was gradually renovated and the museum exhibits displayed in a representative didactical-visual concept.
The reconstructed collection of stone monuments on the ground floor and museum halls reopened in 1968.
In 1973 the prehistoric room on the 1st and the classical, late Roman and medieval exhibits on the 2nd floor of the museum opened.
The museum halls of the Archaeological Museum of Istria are constantly being extended; supplemented with new finds from archaeological sites in Istria (prehistoric caves, hill forts and necropolises, Roman economic complexes, buildings and cemeteries, as well as sacral edifices from the early Christian and Byzantine period, the barbaric invasion and the settlement of the Slavs in Istria).

It is one of the two chapels built in the 6th century as part of a large Benedictine abbey demolished in the 16th century.
The floor and walls were decorated with mosaics, some of which are now in the Archaeological Museum of Istria.
It was built in the style of Ravenna churches, the only difference being the use of stone instead of brick.
Due to its dimensions, method of construction and good state of preservation, the Chapel represents an extraordinary architectural masterpiece of its time.

Built in the second half of the 6th century, with a typical Ravenna-like polygonal apse, the church was dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary.
After its radical reconstruction around 1200, it was assigned to the Greek Orthodox community in Pula in 1583 formed by immigrants from Cyprus and Nauplion: Today it belongs to the Serbian Orthodox church.
It keeps the iconostasis of the Greek master Tomios Batos from the 18th century, valuable icons and other objects.

The oldest preserved remains of the church wall from the beginning of the 4th century can be seen from outside: the lower part of the rear wall belongs to this period.
Due to a fire in 1242 the church underwent reconstruction on several occasions.
While the upper windows of the nave were built in the early Christian period, the windows of the aisles bear typical Gothic traits.

After the Arsenal was founded in 1856, Pula faced a period of intensive building, marked by the construction of new buildings mostly related to the activities of the main naval port of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy: from the Naval hospital and Naval cemetery to numerous barracks of the Hydrographic Institute, Marine Casino, military and civil buildings, residential buildings for officers and civil servants, as well as residential buildings for workers and lower grade clerks.
In 1903 was the inauguration of the Market, a covered construction.
At that time it was an extraordinary event, because for the first time iron and glass were used as the newest building material.
That is why it was very popular and apeared very often on postcards.
The whole mantel creating the outside wall was made entirely of iron construction supports and glass surfaces.
The trading areas in the ground floor are spacious and functional, and till today the building has not lost its purpose, the belly of the town.
It is the centre of the morning town life and everyone who wishes to feel the spirit of the Mediterranean should pass through its fish-market, take a glance at stalls with fruits and vegetable, take a coffee on its terrace and eavesdrop the morning throng and buzz of the town.
Especially interesting are the great number of private villas for higher ranked officers and civil servants, mostly located in the southern suburb Sv.
Policarp.
The houses with one or two apartments were set along quiet streets and surrounded by greenery.
Numerous ornaments, sculptures and architectural details bear the features of Viennese Secession that gave entire Pula an air of a Central European city.
Some of the finest examples are Villa Horty, Villa Wolf and many others.

On the slope of the hill between the Forum and the upper circular street, lies the monastic complex dedicated to St. Francis of Assisi, built in the 14th century at the site of a previous cultic edifice.
The Franciscan community was first recorded in Pula in the 13th century.
The church was built in 1314 in the late Romanesque style with Gothic ornaments, as a firm and simple building of the preaching Franciscan order.
The finely cut stone blocks used for building the walls speak of the skilful masters who took part in the construction.

The main square of classical and medieval Pula is situated at the foot of the central hill, in the western part of the city close to the sea.
The coast where the Forum was constructed in the 1st century BC had to be filled up to gain a larger area.
The Forum was the nucleus of city life, its religious, administrative, legislative and commercial center.
On the northern part of the Forum stood two twin temples and a central one dedicated to Jupiter, Juno and Minerva.
Today only the Temple of Augustus has been fully preserved while of the second temple only the back wall, built into the Communal Palace in the 13th century, is visible.

It stands between two, most probably medieval towers, of simple construction built of uncarved stone blocks.
At the top of the damaged arch, although hardly recognizable, is a carving of the head of Hercules and his club.
Close to the club is a damaged inscription, most interesting in the historical context since it contains the names of two Roman officials, Lucius Calpurnius Piso and Gaius Cassius Longinus to whom the Roman Senate had entrusted the duty to found a Roman colony at the site of today’s Pula.
Thus, between 47 and 44 BC Pula was founded as a settlement with urban features.
Since the upper circular street passed though this gate, the axis of communication was obliquely placed with respect to the direction of the city walls.

After the bombing of World War II remains of Roman houses with mosaics were found under the block of houses around the Chapel of St. Maria Formosa.
The most impressive one is surely the floor mosaic with the central field presenting the mythological scene of the “Punishment of Dirce”(Amphion and Zethus are tying Dirce to an enraged bull, since out of envy Dirce had been cruel to their mother Antiope.)
This figural scene presents the central field of a large floor mosaic composition (12 m x 6 m).
The entire mosaic composition is divided into two equal sections with altogether 40 decorated areas dominated by geometrical patterns with animal details (fish and bird).
The mosaic covered the floor of a central room of a Roman house, probably from the 3rd century.
It has been preserved at the site where it was found, so that the level of house floors in the Roman times, which is 2 m below today’s level, is clearly visible.

At the time when Pula was a free municipality, a palace was erected in the Forum – the seat of the municipal self-government.
During the Venetian rule it was the seat of the duke and provveditore, and until the present has remained the seat of the mayor.
Additions over the centuries (from the 10th -16th centuries) led to a building that in an exceptional way combines architectural styles from the Romanesque until the Renaissance.
The inscription built in the facade, which was restored in the 16th century, dates the construction of the Communal Palace to 1296.
The year probably refers to the first greater reconstruction and addition, because this was surely the seat of the municipal government even earlier.
Earlier phases of the development of the Communal Palace in terms of its construction can best be seen on the eastern wall where Romanesque and Gothic styles intertwine.
Sculptures of Telamon and Siren in the corners closed by Renaissance columns, and Baroque windows are the latest alterations of the outer appearance of the Communal Palace: neglect and negligence have left considerable traces on the building that has recently been radically restored.

The most famous and important monument, the starting and ending point of every sightseeing tour is the Amphitheater, popularly called the Arena of Pula, which was once the site of gladiator fights.
It was built in the 1st century AD during the reign of Emperor Vespasian, at the same time as the magnificent Colosseum in Rome.
The ground plan is elliptical, the longer axis measuring about 130 m and the shorter one about 100 m. Gladiator fights took place in the central flat area called the arena, while the spectators could sit on the stone tiers or stand in the gallery.
It is believed that the Amphitheater could seat about 20,000 spectators.
Local limestone was used for its construction.
In the Middle Ages it was the site of knights tournaments and fairs.
The underground passages, once used by the gladiators, nowadays host a regular exhibition of viticulture and olive growing in Istria in ancient times.
The exhibits include reconstructions of machines once used for the production of olive oil and wine (mills, presses, vessels) and amphorae used for storing and transporting olive oil and wine.

It covers an area of 480 square meters and is an ideal venue for lectures and concerts.
The museum and gallery center is situated in the one-time Church of the Sacred Hearts that was built by the nuns of that holy order in 1908. The church was closed after World War II, and was then given to the Archaeological Museum of Istria.
Its renovation began in 1994 and so, after 17 years Pula finally has a very impressive museum and gallery center.

Research that began last year in the building of the Archaeological Museum, which is currently being renovated, already shows that this institution conceals treasures, not only within its walls, but also below the surface.
Altogether 232 sq meters, 4 meters in height have been researched.
In addition to many finds from Antiquity, a layer with regularly arranged amphorae that served for draining away water and fragments of stone monuments have been found.

The Temple, situated in the Forum, is dedicated to goddess Roma and Emperor Augustus.
It was constructed between the year 2 BC and AD 14 when the Emperor died.
According to its shape it follows the typical pattern of temples.
The function of the Temple changed through the years: with the ending of the pagan ancient era its original pagan function ceased and the temple was afterwards used as a church, granary, and in the beginning of the 19th century it was a museum for stone monuments.
In 1944 it was hit by a bomb and completely destroyed.
It was reconstructed between the years 1945 and 1947 and nowadays it houses a collection of ancient stone and bronze sculptures.
The other twin temple, of which only the back wall is preserved, is believed to have been constructed at the same time and in the same style and was called the Temple of Diana.

Visualia Festival – the festival of light, presents the magic and beauty of new technologies and audiovisual art and at the same time has a great impact on city branding.
Pula’s Visualia Festival was held for the first time in 2013, with 3D Mapping, and its program has been increasing every year.
Already the following year it also included the “Lighting Giants”, illuminated cranes of Uljanik Shipyard, which have become the city’s new attraction and symbol.
In 2015, the Guinness world record was broken in the Arena, for the largest photography of people forming a light sign, known as the “Light Postcard”.

In the second half of the 19th century, in the area beneath the old Kaštel, a park was designed.
Paths were built, flowerbeds arranged, grass sown, trees planted.
The area was later transformed into a marketplace.
In the beginning of the 20th century some hundred hackberry trees were planted in four rows that even nowadays offer shade to the citizens of Pula and chance-travelers.
The old photograph shows that the planted trees were properly raised in one of the then nurseries with a very finely developed crown and straight trunk.
All seedlings were of the same habitus.
Some of them did not stand the test of time, so that only eighty have remained until the present being the most precious green oasis in the heart of the city.
The trees are a silent witness of changes of government, culture and generations in Pula.
Nowadays they are about twenty meters high.
From the vast promenade the stairs led to the City museum.
They were at the same time a communication of the city, extending beyond the city walls, with the old core of Kaštel.
Since Pula had a streetcar communication from one side of the city to another during the Austro-Hungarian rule, one of the city lines led along Giardini.
Beside the road and along the promenade there were streetlights giving a romantic atmosphere.
East of Giardini is the Roman monument – the Triumphal Arch of the Sergi, one of the points of interest on a sightseeing tour of the city and the reason why there are so many people at Giardini.
In the deep shade of the trees the caterers have spread out their cafés so that you can have a drink enjoying the murmur of tiny leaves.
Throughout its history Giardini was the meeting place and site of various events.
Already in the first half of the 20th century book fairs and occasional sales were held here.
This tradition continued even later so that it was the site of film projections, concerts and other social events.
“Korzo”, as the promenade was named after the War, thus became the main social gathering place.
The photograph from the beginning of the century still shows the green belt between the line of trees and the upper road, which was all that remained from the previous gardens.
That belt was greatly reduced during the bombing in World War II.
After the War, remains of the city walls were found and reconstructed.
Archaeological excavation around the Triumphal Arch of the Sergi in 1995 removed the last remains of greenery.
The beautiful holm oak planted at the beginning of the century was pulled down, as well as the hedge of bitter orange (Poncirus trifoliatus), the only example in Pula.
Presently, apart from the canal, Giardini is separated from the old city walls of Kaštel, by a hedge of firethorn (Pyracantha coccinea).

If you wish to escape from the swarming streets and sweltering heat of the city on a summer afternoon into a colorful autumn or a scented spring morning you should go to Šijana Forest.
Surely you won’t regret it.
Only two kilometers from the very center of the city you will find heaven for your body and soul.
The narrow winding labyrinth-like paths at every curve reveal surprises, a small animal or a beautiful specimen of forest flora.
Through the tall tree tops the sunrays shyly protruding just to enable you to see where a certain path leads.
It is equally nice here in spring when the soil is covered with fragrant carpets of cyclamen and in autumn when under the fallen leaves you can discern caps of many species of mushrooms.
Admire them in their natural habitat, rather than picking them!
All flora and fauna in this forest is protected, so all you can take home are memories of such lovely sights.
There is a legend that is connected with Šijana Forest.
On Good Friday in 1271 members of the wealthy Castropola family of Pula were killed by conspirators.
The loyal servant only managed to save the son and hide him in the Franciscan monastery where he was brought up.
Later, in gratitude he offered Šijana to the monastery.
In 1860 the administration over the forest was taken over by the navy.
At the beginning of the last century it was called Kaiserwald (Imperial Forest), when it served as a rest area and recreation grounds for the Austro-Hungarian army and gentry.
They came to the forest by various means of transport: carriages, cars, bicycles and already at the time there was a need to design the park and connect the streetcar with the center.
In recent detailed research Šijana park forest is described as a community of downy oak and oriental hornbeam, and the immediate vicinity of sea water, with the vegetation area of holm oak, is why this species appears more often in the warmer locations of the forest.
Šijana park forest covers an area of 152.13 hectares and characteristic are examples of foliates and conifers.
Visitors should be enabled to discover the values of specific species due to their impressiveness and rareness.
Such are examples of cork oak (Quercus suber), downy oak (Quercus pubescens) and Turkish pine (Pinus brutia).

It does not extend from other parks in town.
It has a rectangular shape and a total surface of 3,000m2.
The exceedingly beautiful developed trees of large-leaf linden (Tilia platyphyllos) offer a mild scent and pleasant shade during hot summer days.
Dried flowers of this beautiful deciduous species make a tasty hot or cold drink successfully used in curing cardiovascular disorders.

The park named after the twinned-city of Pula lies in the very center of the city between the main pedestrian and automobile communication directions.
It was built in 1957 on the ruins of buildings destroyed in air raids, so that the base on which it lies is inadequate and does not meet the requirements of a modern city park.
Although it is not grand by design, it attracts attention because of the archaeological remains scattered in the park which is why it was called Archaeological Park until the 1960s.
In its center lies a group of nice holm oak, the Istrian autochthonous oak, a species that dominates on the vegetation map of Istria.
We find here a unique example of wild-growing fig tree – Mediterranean fruit, which is a must among Istrian food.
Figs can be eaten fresh, dried, in brandy, jam and fig cake.
Along the road between the tall hackberry trees lie shrubs of myrtle (Myrtus communis).
This Mediterranean plant is naturally found in Istrian vegetation and is yet another “aromatic” member of Mediterranean flora.
Namely, myrtle essential oil successfully cures respiratory problems and builds the immune system.
NEWLYWED’S PARK
It was designed in the 1950s, but gained its full splendor at the end of the century when the automatic irrigation system was introduced.
Since then its area of over 1,000 m2 has been well tended, colorful annuals planted and shrubs and hedges trimmed and clipped.
The decorative illumination beneath the slender cypresses creates a special atmosphere in the park at night, so that newlyweds after saying the great “I do” often take pictures on the bench of this park.
All rights reserved &copy; 2018 Turistička zajednica grada Pule
The park is a logical continuation of the previous park and was built in 1953 on an area of 3,380m2.
In 1960 a fountain made of Istrian stone was built as a symbol of potable water supply to Pula from the source in the Raša valley.
The park has yet another peculiarity.
It is the octagonal Roman mausoleum from the 1st century built at the site of the Roman necropolis.
Shrubs of tamarisk, oleander and spirea are a magnificent floral sight inviting to pleasure, while the gracious bell-like white yucca flowers on a long stem “break” the grayness of the chilly autumn days.
Beautiful floral groups of annuals of decorative sage, marigold and ageratum bloom every summer in all rainbow colors, and in early spring the spectrum of pansy and daisy colors brings life into the gray and green shrubs of lavender and santolina.
The entire park is presently dominated by the beautiful Atlas cedar (Cedrus atlantica glauca) with bluish needles of extremely regular crown and trunk.
All rights reserved &copy; 2018 Turistička zajednica grada Pule
The construction of the park began in the 1940s and was completed in 1953.
In the front part along the sea a monument in memory of the fallen fighters by Vanja Radauš was erected here in 1957.
This very popular park provides rest on its benches to the elder visitors in the shade of the impressive plane-trees and pines all year round.
Besides the Aleppo pine, its majority is formed of flowering shrubs of spirea, Judas tree, tamarisk, oleander and Japanese cherry that with its beautiful colors liven the area during its flowering in spring and summer.
Oleander shrub is a recognizable species of the Mediterranean climate, that by its flowering throughout the summer attracts the attention of passers-by.
The green parts of this plant are poisonous and one should be careful that the white juice the plant releases does not come in contact with the mucous membrane.
In the botanical world this species counts for an indicator of water, as it feels the presence of water even if it is deeper under ground.

The central motif in the park was a fountain where a brass statue of Cupid was put up in 1897.
It was removed after several years and in 1904 replaced by a statue of the Austrian Empress Elisabeth.
The statue was destroyed and removed in 1934 and in 1940 replaced by the Roman she-wolf with Romulus and Remus.
After World War II the Italian government removed it and in 1953, at that very site, a monument representing the Sailor, in honor of the mutiny of sailors in 1918, was erected, but again this monument was removed in 1995.
During the Italian rule the park was named after Prince Umberto.
Species planted in this park were similar to those at Monte Zaro.
One finds here cedar, cypress, yucca, chusan palm, European fan palm, laurel, oleander, yew and guelder rose.
Yew (Taxus baccata) is a protected plant species in Croatia, so it is a real treasure to have such beautiful specimens as park heritage.
Everything on it is poisonous except the decorative scarlet fleshy aril enclosing the seeds.
On the same plant are both male and female flowers, so nearby there should be specimens of both sex for the plant to bear fruit.
Yew is ideal for trimming and forming various shapes and also adapts well to city conditions.
Here, just as in Naval Park (Mornarički park), there are fine specimens of the coast sequoia, exotic species that will surely attract every visitor’s attention.
Common or Mediterranean cypress (Cupressus sempervirens) is a species found in almost all the parks of Pula.
It is represented in two forms, horizontal and distinctly pyramidal, that is used as a vertical when designing parks.
A well-known fact is that even ancient Greeks and Romans used cypress branches for disinfecting their homes.
Apart from this, cypress essential oil is very useful for restoring the immune system; it is efficient when dealing with respiratory diseases and circulation and has an extremely soothing effect.
Yucca (Yucce gloriosa) originates from North and Central America.
Its large, white and upright flowers already in late winter draw everyone’s attention.
Today, just as a century ago, the most represented species in this park are laurel shrubs that are clipped and trimmed skillfully in various forms.
Laurel (Laurus nobilis) is a typical species for this region, which grows in areas between Mediterranean and semi-Mediterranean forests.
It has lush cluster-like yellow flowers, whereas its leaves, wood and fruit are rich in essential oil.
Therefore, one should have it nearby because of its therapeutic effect in the treatment of respiratory diseases.
Laurel essential oil used as an air purifier helps to prevent infections.
Apart from this, it is an essential spice used in preparing Mediterranean specialties, as it adds a special flavor.
It is also believed that laurel protects from lightning, evil and contagious diseases, so it was often planted near houses.
Laurel leaves have long since been a symbol of military glory, but resurrection as well, so ancient Romans used to adorn their doors with laurel wreaths for New Year.

In the second half of the 19th century the city began to spread to the north and east, so the building of residential areas was accompanied by the concept of creating green oases in those parts of the city.
Since the spreading of the city to the north was limited by the existing bay (Valle del Ponte), during the Austro-Hungarian rule this part of the coast, so-called mandrač (tiny port), was filled up and reclaimed.
Such an area was then used to design a park, which was to meet the needs of future residents.
In close proximity of City Park (Gradski park), the first city hotel “Riviera” was built at the beginning of the 20th century, which is even today considered a true gem of Secession.
The park opposite the hotel was also called Riviera, and in 1918 both parks were named after the Italian Queen and called Parco Regina Elena.
Villas Münz, with mostly prosperous residents, were already built next to the hotel, thus such a public garden in the surrounding area was simply a must.

Today, there are about 20 plant species and the most numerous are laurel, guelder rose, Aleppo pine and cedar.
Among the cedars are Atlas cedar, Himalayan cedar and the most impressive – the cedar of Lebanon.
The easiest way to distinguish them is by the arrangement of branches in relation to the trunk.
The Atlas cedar has branches growing slantingly towards the top, the top of the Himalayan cedar, as well as the tips of its branches bend downward, whereas the branches of the cedar of Lebanon are vertical to the trunk so the crown has a wide umbrella-like form, resembling somewhat a Japanese pagoda.
This last species is highly esteemed in shipping and there are specimens over 1,000 years old.
Another well-represented conifer is the Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis ) which is very significant for this area since it endures salt well and therefore is often planted near the sea.
Apart from that, it is ideal for afforesting and is often used as a so-called pioneer species to prepare the ground for other higher quality specimens.
This is a typical Mediterranean species, which is autochthonous in our southern coastal region.

The first city park dates from 1863.
It is situated between today’s Arsenalska, Rizzijeva and Besenghijeva streets.
It covers an area of about 12,000 m2 and has a rectangular form.
The paths are covered with gravel and account for more than a third of the park’s entire area.
In 1876, on the largest central plateau a marble column, several meters high, was erected in honor of Archduke Maximilian, commander in chief of the Austrian navy, brother of Franz Joseph II, so the park was at that time called Maximilian’s Park.
Until 1914 it contained specimens of 63 different plant species that were brought by ships from all over the world.
Some of them have survived and can still be seen today.
When Pula came under the Italian rule, the park changed its name into Naval Park (Mornarički park), and in 1919 the statue of Maximilian was taken to Venice.
During the Italian rule each plant had its name in Latin, German and vernacular, and in 1956 all the names were listed in Italian and Croatian.
At the time it was even called Botanical Park.
Today it contains some 40 plant species.
Especially interesting and valuable are specimens of exotic coast sequoia (Sequoia sempervirens).
It has a slender, tall trunk and very unusual bark up to 30 cm thick which is soft under pressure and deeply furrowed, so it protects the cambium from fire.
Its cones are small and the needles soft.
The sequoia grows on the Pacific Coast and California, and in its natural habitat can reach a height of up to 100 meters, so it is among the tallest conifers and along with the eucalyptus ranks among true green giants.
Impressive and well-preserved specimens of pines (Pinus pinea) are interesting not only because of their delicious and edible seeds – pine nuts, but also their distinctively regular umbrella-like crown in older trees and deeply furrowed reddish-brown bark that peels off in thick plates.
Its cones are thick and large, and the seeds mature in autumn of the second year, whereas the cones split open in spring of its third year.
The seeds are very tasty raw, but roasted as well, so they are often added to various sauces served with gastronomic delicacies

During the Austro-Hungarian rule, mostly allochthonous plant species and exotic species were planted in the pubic gardens of Pula, while only few were autochthonous, and are found in these parks even today.
Although among the mentioned species brought from abroad are those that were not able to adapt to the new pedological-climatic conditions, so they either did not survive or they are in a poor state today, there is also a considerable number of those planted in that period, that are found in city parks today and truly have an ornamental function.
The period of Italian rule was also characterized by planting of mainly allochthonous species, which in their country of origin had ecological conditions very similar to ours.
Most of them acclimatized and adapted to the new surroundings very well, so they are well represented in the parks of Pula today.
The older citizens of Pula vividly remember their city as a wonderful green oasis on the very south of the Istrian Peninsula.
One will often hear them talk about bygone days, mentioning benches in parks, murmur of water from the fountains in Naval Park (Mornarički park) or at Monte Zaro, as well as the impeccably clipped hedge in all parks of that time.
The trend today is to restore at least part of their onetime splendor.
From the old postcards and photographs of the city of Pula, one regretfully sees that a greater part of such treasure has been lost forever.
Today, parks are mainly used for easier and quicker communication between destination points, but rarely as a stopping point.
Exceptions are certain age groups (children and pensioners) that spend a greater part of their free time in parks.
Parks are only a small part of the rich cultural and historical heritage of Pula during the 3,000 years of its existence and therefore present an irreplaceable ornament with the valuable collection of plant species almost 150 years old.
Owing to the mild climate and more or less successful selection of species, many of them, although exotic species or allochthonous, have survived until today so in their new habitat they have features of neophytes (flower, fructify and propagate without man’s help).
Over the past several years the old topiary technique of trimming and clipping plants in parks is being introduced again.
These parks were once designed in such a way and the plant species present enable that technique.
So, the parks of Pula are once again regaining their characteristic appearance.

A tour of the sights of Pula would not be complete without a stroll through its well-preserved and beautifully designed parks.
Each and every one of them tells a different story from a certain period of Pula’s history.
So, every visitor is eager to unveil some guarded secret or love story and take it along back with him.
This is just that little “something” needed to round off the complete sensation.
Not all parks were designed at the same time, therefore their style and arrangement are different.
Some have a regular pattern, with plants clipped and trimmed in various geometrical forms, others are more “casual”, both by their concept and plant species they contain.
Most of today’s parks of Pula originate from the Austro-Hungarian period, whereas the period of the Italian rule and more recent times have left only minor traces in the public garden culture of the city.
All parks which developed during that period have a characteristic well-planned arrangement of paths, water supply system and a professional selection of plants.

Pula’s restaurants offer a variety of great delicacies
In Pula, just as in most towns of Istria, be sure to taste seafood specialties, of which frogfish, sea bass or delicious stewed savory buzara with Kvarner scampi are just some of the offered delicacies.
You should also try clams in Pula, because owing to the clean sea the local ones are especially tasty.
Oysters are delicious too; the only thing to add is a few drops of lemon.
In Pula you should also try maneštra, traditional thick soup, the main ingredients of which are potatoes and beans with pešt (bacon and garlic roux).
This delicacy is even tastier when bobići (young corn) or crumbled corn is added, and just as delicious with chickpeas and barley.
When cooking maneštra very often the bone of Istrian prosciutto is put inside.
Another specific taste is achieved if it is prepared with young fennel.
Jota is a variety of maneštra in which, apart from the basic ingredients of potatoes and beans, sauerkraut is added.
The influence of Italian cuisine in Istria is best felt in different types of tasty pasta offered in Pula.
The most popular are fuži and gnocchi.
Fuži are made with eggs, flour and water.
The mixture is then kneaded into smooth dough, which is rolled out and cut into rectangular shapes and then folded over.
Gnocchi are prepared with flour, eggs and potatoes kneaded into dough.
Fuži and gnocchi are usually served with various sauces, locally known as šugo.
The most traditional one is žgvacet, sauce made with onions, tomatoes, chicken and seasoning.
In addition to fuži and gnocchi be sure to taste other delicious types of pasta like ravioli, pljukanci, pasutice or makaruni na žlicu.
Ravioli is pasta with different types of filling, a special type is definitely Labin krafi.. A recommended dish for vegetarians is posutice with fresh cabbage, which has a specific taste when olive oil and garlic are added.
At the end of the meal in Pula you will be offered simple yet very tasty sweets, the most traditional and typical ones are kroštule, fritule and cukerančići.
On the other hand, if you are served povetica (walnut roll) or peaches be sure to taste them.
The perfect wine to accompany dessert and fulfill this experience is typical Istrian Muscat, a wine with a strong characteristic flavor and semi-sweet bouquet.

The members of the association Spectacula gladiatoria last weekend (from 16<sup>th</sup> to 18<sup>th</sup> September) visited Tivoli, nearby Rome, where they were invited to participate to the tournament that revoked gladiatorial games.
The school Spectacula gladiatoria earned most points and won the first prize.
Spectacula gladiatorial started activities in 2013, the same time as the program Spectacula antiqva, thanks to the efforts and interest of the Tourist Office of the City of Pula, the Archeological Museum of Istria and the company Pula spot d.o.o.
One of the visions in creating the project is to make the Pula exhibition the best in the world, and that is proved also by this prize, in particular the fact that it was won in Rome, thanks to the domination over the local school Ludus Magnus.
Spectacula gladiatoria is, traditionally, the holder of the program Spectacvula Antiqva, a program which, with about a dozen manifestations in Summer attracts to the amphitheater in Pula more than 22,000 visitors, both domestic and foreign, and  has become a reason for visiting Pula and the Arena and, considering that the project is completely self-financed and the number of targeted visits, it has overcome similar projects both in Croatia and in Europe.
At the moment in Europe there are about ten gladiatorial and about twenty cultural societies dealing with the period of the antiquity, whose members are all passionate lovers of the ancient period, the most important one both for the old and the new era.
The Antiquity left deep traces in the European and whole western culture and in the 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> century it has become the mainstay in creating the identity of the majority of west European cities and, at the same time, the brand used for promotional purposes in tourism, sports, culture, science and economy.
Those achievements confirm the correct orientation in creating the programmatic identity and brand of the City of Pula and Istria, among other as a destination of cultural tourism and history.

The Glagolitic script is an ancient Slavic script, which was createdat the beginning of ninth century and was used until the early 19 century when an increasing role was given to Latin alphabet.
The Glagolitic alphabet was initially rounded, then squared and then had 32 characters.
It has a numerical value so that the first nine letters are ones and the following nine letters are tens,further nine letters are hundreds and following nine letters are thousands.The strongest bases of theGlagolitic are: Croatian Adriatic coast, Istriaand the island of Krk, where the oldest stone monuments have been found, from the 12thand 13th century: Valunska tablet, Plomin inscription, Grdoselski and Supetar fragment and the Ba&scaron;ka Tablet.

Constantine Cyril.With it,the church books, town statutes and laws, carvings on the walls, carved messages on crucifixes, even on church bells, were written.
Today it is a priceless heritage, the best preserved exactly in the central Istrian region.The modernagehas built a unique monument of Glagolitic culture and literacy - the Glagolitic Alley with eleven memorials which have been set up along the road between the smalltowns of Roč and Hum
The basilica in Betiga, left of the road between the village and the new tourist village, is dedicated to St. Andrew.
Only some parts of the wall and the shrine are what was left from the basilica, including a stone trefoil and a floor mosaic (about a hundred square meters) which used to cover some 25 meters in length.
After that there was a Benedictine monastery there until the 13th century when the plague came to this area.
Churches
A Late-Gothic church of the Mother of God, dominating the Square, was built to the right side of the Town Gate by Master Dento in 1425 to the order of the local villager-nobleman Petar Beračić.
This fact witnesses that in the Middle Ages there was a privileged class, which had money to build churches, but also profane building such as the Salomon Place.
The internal eastern wall of the church is covered over its whole length by a large wall painting depicting the Adoration of the Magi, originating from the same period.
Many would ask what the nails driven between the blocks of the external wall of this beautiful church mean.
The legend says that over the times, on the Solemnity of the Assumption of Mary, childless women would drive in the nails believing that they would conceive by Devine Mercy.
Churches
Chapel of St. AnthonyNext to the Church stands the Chapel of St. Anthony, built by Master Almerigo in 1381 with regularly cut stone blocks.
The Chapel was renovated in 1486 by Pascasius, Bishop of Pićan, born at Grači&scaron;će.
St. Agatha's Church lies at the old city cemetery.
With its trefoil apse, it is an example of Romanesque sacral architecture.
Its construction with three naves, a saddle roof and a specific sanctuary that extends through the choir of the central apse, make it especially interesting.
The church is dated to the period between the 9th and the 13th century.
In addition to Carolingian influences, it also bears features typical of the regional sacral architecture of the Middle Ages.
Its interior harbours two Late Baroque sculptures of local origin (light-bearing angels) and an altar depiction of St. Agatha.
The church was restored and conserved in 1993 - 1995.

Austro-Hungarian Emperor Franz Joseph I was especially interested in the planning of the Naval Church in Pula.
He was also present at the foundation stone laying ceremony in 1891, at Stoja, in the area of Pula-Pola known as San Policarpo.
The consecration ceremony of the Church of Our Lady of the Sea was held in 1898.
The entire plan also included the surrounding area with stairs descending towards the sea.
Today, it particularly stands out thanks to its exterior rows of white stone from Brijuni and red marble from Oprtalj-Portole and Brtonigla-Verteneglio.
Its mosaics are reminiscent of those in the Basilica of Euphrasius in Poreč and St. Mark's in Venice.
In front of the portal of Our Lady of the Sea especially interesting are columns tied in a Samson knot.

Three-nave church of Blessed Virgin Mary's Birth built in 1336 on the foundations of the small church from the 11th century.
It was reconstructed several times.
The last reconstruction was in 1993.
A Venetian lion with a sphere in his mouth - a symbol of Labin recognizing the Venetian government - was put on the front facade in 1604.
By the end of that century, in 1688, a baroque statue of senator Antonio Bollani, a combatant against Turks, was put on the same facade.
The bust is one of the most beautiful examples of the secular sculptural art of Istria in the 17th century.
On the right from the church, there is a palace which belonged to the Schampicchio family.
Church of the B. V.Mary's Birth decorated with six marble altars.
One of them has St.Justin's relics brought here from Rome in 1664.
Main altar and altarpiece with six figures of B.V.M., St.Pauline and Saints: Justin, Sergio, Julian, Tom and Jacob.
The author is Natale Schiacione from Dalmatia, the much more valuable altarpiece by the altar of the Madonna of Carmel from the l7th century is believed to be done by the famous painter Jacopo Negriti, better known as Palma the Younger.
Valentin Lukas, a young Labin painter from the 19th century; is the author of the painting featuring the Stages of the Cross.
Churches
On the slope of the hill between the Forum and the upper circular street, lies the monastic complex dedicated to St. Francis of Assisi, built in the 14th century at the site of a previous cultic edifice.
The Franciscan community was first recorded in Pula-Pola in the 13th century.
The church was built in 1314 in the late Romanesque style with Gothic ornaments, as a firm and simple building of the preaching Franciscan order.
The finely cut stone blocks used for building the walls speak of the skilful masters who took part in the construction.
Churches
The aisleless small church was built in the 14th century probably on the foundations of an olderone from the 9th century whose remains have not been preserved.
The subsequently added portico ("lopica")is from the 17th century.
The interior has a ribbed vaulting, walls still bear traces of frescoes from the15th century, while the altar holds a wooden polychrome sculpture of the Virgin with Child, also from the 15th century.It was most probably made by a local master influenced by the Friulian workshops.
Churches
Many consider Concetta (Church of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary), the oldest church in the Galižana area.
The church was built on the foundations of an ancient oil mill.
Restored in the early 20th century the church has a single nave with apse.
Above the door of the church, from the inside, Gothic Fresca was discovered.
Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand came to Concetta on his way to Brijuni which he frequently visited.
Churches
This church, dating from the first half of the 17th century, s built in the style of the Renaissance, but has some Baroque elements too.
The facade and the Renaissance portal are very plain.
On both sides of the portal there are two windows provived with iron bars.Until the requisition of the bells for war purposes during the World War I and II in the belfry there were two bells made in the Venetian foundries (from the 17th and 18th century).
Teh bell with the signature OPVS CASTELLIS made in the 16th century in the Venetian foundry was removed in the World War I.
It was replaced by the bell made in the foundry Lapagna in Triest 1922. this bell, as well as the other one from 17th century, decorated with images of St. Fosca, the Madonna and crucifixion and provided with the Latin text SANCTA FVSCA VRSARIAE MDCLXXX (St. Fosca of Vrsar-Orsera 1680) was taken away by the Italians during the World War II.
However, these bells were not used for war purposes.
Today they can be seen in the bell tower of the parish church of St. Martin.The church of St. Fosca has been recently renovated.
In it there is a sacral collection containing valuable exhibits, such as the picture ''Martyrdom of St. Fosca'' dating from the 17th century.
Especially attractive are the sepulchral slabs decorated with coat-of-arms and Latin texts.
In front of the main altar there is the tomb of the Vrsar-Orsera priest Luka Prodanić (Luca Prodanich), Croat, who died in 1659.
On the slab the clerical symbols (Chalice and host) are engraved.
Churches
At the end of the street leading from the Square, between the Church of the Mother of God and the Chapel of St. Anthony, is the Church of St. Euphemia, built in 1383 and thoroughly renovated in 1864.
The church still keeps the monumental crucifix from the 13th century and the renovated altar of the Mother of God, Patron of the Church of the Mother of God na Placu.
From the church of St. Euphemia to the south stretches the Pod Fumiju Street.
It was the street of craftsmen and one of them, a blacksmith, engraved a hammer, the symbol of his craft, over his door next to the year 1451.
The Street, which has retained its original appearance without major modifications, led out of the town through the South Gate, next to the recently renovated and impressive round tower built around 1500.
It was through this Gate that the poljanci &ndash; the inhabitants of the surrounding villages entered the town looking for the services of craftsmen.
Churches
This small church is the most interesting sacral structure in the Buzet area, since it is defined by three periods and phases of construction.
The rectangular Romanesque nave was built first, then the late-Romanesque presbytery was added on the eastern side.
The apses reveal lovely Gothic windows with pointed upper parts, elaborate features and original glass which is rarely seen in Istria.
Churches
The town square is dominated by St. Barbara church, the patron of all miners.
The church itself is shaped like an upturned coal-mine cart, while the church tower reminds of a coal mine lamp.
Church arcades resemble coal mine galleries as well.
Churches
On the east part of the square, the Parish Church of Annunciation is situated.
It was built in the early 16th century and has a Renaissance trefoil facade made of domestic dressed stone.
The interior is distinguished by five marble altars with altar paintings all belonging to Venetian school.Especially valuable are the altar of St. Victoria with the painting showing the Mother of Lord with angels, altars of St. Sebastian and St. Roch, work of Palma Junior, and the main altar with the altar painting of the Annunciation, the work of Guiseppe Porto- Salviati, commissioned by the Grimany family.
The body of St. Victoria which was moved from Rome to Svetvinčenat in 1669 is honoured in the church.
Churches
Beside the old Roman road below the village of Batvači there is the Church of Saint Fo&scaron;ka (6th -7th century).
The basilica was built from two parts: from a narrow and ascetically shadowy church with three naves divided with short pillars and an ethereal lodge which was a sanctuary for many pilgrims coming from all over.
The shrine is adorned by valuable wall paintings from the 12th century, some of the oldest ones in Istria.
Churches
On the road to Fažana lies the Church of St. Anthony, abbot and hermit, probably from the 13th century.
Since the economy of Vodnjan in the past was based on cattle breeding, as protector of domestic animals, the church bears dedication to this saint.
The church is an aisleless edifice with an apse.
Its walls still show fragments of frescoes from the 13th and 14th centuries.
Oxen and cows were brought for benediction on the saint's feast day, while blessed salt was carried home for other animals.
Owing to the Vodnjan benefactor Angelo Cecon, the church was renovated in 1894 and a retirement home was built at the site.
Churches
This small church dated back from the 15<sup>th</sup> century is located very close to St. Rocco.
Above the door is a sign whose content has not been deciphered, with the date - 09/02/1443.
On the outside of the church there are series of spoils with braided ornaments, made sometime in the 10th or 11th century.
It is assumed that the three Greek crosses, carved on the facade, are from the older religious building which was probably located in the same place before the construction of this church.

One of the most impressive structures in Vodnjan and entire Istria is certainly the parish church of St. Blaise, well-known to pilgrims from all over the world.
On the site of the present-day parish church once stood a basilica, most probably from the 11th century, that was pulled down in 1760.
The new church was modelled after the Venetian church of San Pietro, and the project itself cost 13,000 gold coins.
The church was financed by the townspeople and its construction lasted from 1760 to 1800.
At that time the locals set aside 10% for the building of the church, whereas over the next ten years they set aside 10% of wine and olive oil.
Today this church is the largest and one of the most magnificent ones in Istria.

The core of the Communal or Town Palace, the site of present-day town administration, dates from the 16th century.
During the course of time, the palace was frequently changed, even decreased in size in the 19th century.
Its foundations date back to 1308, when it was the Praetorian Palace.
The large Town Council Hall, offices and the archives occupied the first floor.
The mural painting from 1580 depicting the allegory of the town administration had been somewhat preserved, recently restored and put on the town council walls.
In one of its phases, the building was used as a prison, located on the ground floor.
The facade of the town or the communal palace is red, additionally emphasized by a white stone portal, windows and stone plates.
The covered walkway through the old town gates was knocked down in 1822.
The facade and the atrium were renovated between 1850 and 1860, when a number of Venetian and Rovinj family crests was put up, including the town coat of arms.
The facade underwent another renovation in 1935, which has given the palace its present appearance.
How to get there:It is located in the near vicinity of the central town square - the Square of Marshal Tito.
It is reached by passing through the Balbi Arch.

The town loggia in Grožnjan dates to the late 16th c. It used to be the court house.The historic core of Grožnjan has many valuable and old houses.
One of the most interesting is the preserved structure from the Venetian period, the town loggia.
Pass through the 15th century town gate, and you will immediately see the Renaissance town loggia from 1587.
It has four columns and a limestone floor.
There are four Roman burial plates inside it.
The loggia used to be the seat of the court as Grožnjan had its own statute, compiled in Italian as part of the 1558 notary document, and divided into four books.
The fontico or the town's food storehouse, was located above the loggia.

The Romanesque House situated on Marafor Square in Poreč was  renovated and extended several times during its history.
Despite  numerous interventions during the time, the house kept the basic  characteristics of the Romanesque residential architecture.
The house  layout is simple and regular, with no inner partitions.
It was built  from simple roughly carved blocks.
The 1926 restoration maintained all  the changes emerged during previous divisions.
Its present-day  appearance stems from the period after WW2 as it had been a part of the  residential complex destroyed by bombing and not restored.
The  Romanesque house is today a detached building.
Erected in the  13th century, its last major divisions were probably made in the 18th  century when the second floor was partitioned and a wooden balcony  added.
Although stemming from later construction work and cannot be  considered an original part of the Romanesque House, the wooden balcony  contributes to the its picturesque quality.
The house ground floor used  for economic purposes is today the gallery.
The first floor is accessed  by the external stone staircase, while the second is reached by the  inner, wooden stairs.
Upper floors are also open for public.
The  Ethnographic Heritage Collection is on exhibit there.

The intensive red colour of its facade, lavishly decorated by architectural elements in white stone are the main characteristics of the Battiala-Lazzarini Palace, presently used by the People's Museum of the town of Labin.The Baroque Battiala-Lazzarini Palace, located in the old town core, next to the Parish Church of the Birth of the Blessed Virgin Mary, is one of the most beautiful structures in Labin.
Its impressive facade, affluently decorated windows and corners, additionally emphasized by white stone from which they were made, opposing the intensive red colour of the walls.
The facade blue doors and windows add to a more dramatic overall impression of the Battiala Lazzarini Palace.
The construction of one of the most beautiful buildings in Labin started in 1630 by the Battiala family.
The palace was built in two phases.
The older part was built in the 17th century, while the facade was started in the early 18th century and completed in 1727.
The impressive structure of almost 1000 m2 in surface consists of a central body which extends in the north-south direction, and the elongated rectangular wing of the east-west direction.
The first palace owners, the Battialas, were of the Turkish-Albanian descent.
They had several estates in Istria, but chose Labin as their residence, in the current Battiala Lazzarini palace.
In the 19th century, a member of the Battiala family, Margherita, married to Lodovico Lazzarinija, marking the beginning of the Labin branch of the Battiala Lazzarini family.
Their family crest had a symbol of mortality, the phoenix, and bore the motto 'Moriendo renascitur'.
The last palace owners were the three brothers, Giuseppe, Nicol&ograve; and Tommaso.
After the WW2, the palace was nationalized as a boarding school at first and then turned into apartments.
From 1960, it has been the site of the People's Museum of the town of Labin.
The building was thoroughly renovated and restored from 1982 until 1994.Prvog svibnja 6, HR-52220 LabinT: +385 (0)52 852 477<a href="mailto:narodni.muzej.labin@pu.t-com.hr" target="_blank">narodni.muzej.labin@pu.t-com.hr</a><a href="http://www.labin.hr/" target="_blank">www.labin.hr</a>

The Morosini-Grimani Castle is a medieval edifice with expressed  Renaissance features.
It was named after the two families, its owners.Svetvinčenat  was erected on the border which changed through history with the  exchange of conquerors.
It was first mentioned in 983 in the document by  Oton II as the property of the Bishop of Poreč.
Its ownership was first  taken over by the Castropola family, and then by the Morosini family in  1384.
Pietro Morosini was last mentioned as the master of Svetvinčenat  in 1529.
The new owners, the Grimani family, were being mentioned in the  written documents since 1560.
The Grimanis renovated the castle after  the fire.
Both families, the Morosinis and the Grimanis are the most  significant in the history of the castle as well as of the entire  village.
This is why the castle was named after them: Morosini-Grimani.
Istrian building heritage of the Venetian era
Note:
The Svetvinčenat square is the most comprehensive example of planned Renaissance urbanism with rows of houses, a cistern and the parish church, naturally.Svetvinčenat is an exceptional example of a planned and inspired erection of a settlement from the early 16th century when the Morosini family became the owner of the castle and feudal lands.
They renovated the castle in its Renaissance form, while Pietro Morosini re-urbanized the entire settlement under the principle of an ideal, regular Renaissance town.
The Large Square, called the Placa among people, has preserved its Renaissance features, harmonious architectural dimensions and simplicity.
In the centre of its trapezoid layout is a stone cistern (the well) made in 1808.
The square is encircled by the castle and the palace on one side, and the Parich Church of the Annunciation of Mary on its eastern narrower side.
The remaining sides are encircled by a row of identical one-storey houses with Renaissance windows and the town loggia.
They are almost identical to the forms of the houses from the late 15th and the 16th centuries built in the Venice folk residential areas.
These are simple and functional structures which monumental feature is provided by a symmetrically placed semi-circular single lancet windows.
The construction of the Parish Church of the Annunciation of Mary dates back to the late 15th century.
It was most probably finished in 1529.
Its facade is simplified, with a trefoil finish existing in Venice.
There is a family crest with Pietro Morosini initials on the facade.
It was built from local stone.
However, its architect has remained unknown.
The southern part of the square has been occupied by the 18th century town loggia with an open porch and six arches with elegant vaults.
The loggia has two entrances, one leading to the main town square, while the other exiting into a side alley.
The square in Svetvinčenat is the most comprehensive example of planned Renaissance urbanism in Croatia.
Its special significance stems from the unique shaping of all carved architectural details on the castle, houses, the loggia and the church.
Istrian building heritage of the Venetian era
The magnificent Soardo-Bembo palace in Bale has a monumental 16th c. Gothic-Renaissance facade.Bale is a little town only a few kilometres away from the sea.
It is located on the hill protruding from the wide plain.
A thick town tissue of concentric and radial streets was placed within the walls and towers of the former defensive system.
Above the town gate and between the two towers of defensive walls, the palace of the Soardo family was built, later taken over by the Bembo family, after whom the palace Soardo-Bembo was named.
It is the most significant structure in Bale, attracting the visitors with the beauty of its recently renovated Gothic-Renaissance facade.
The monumental facade faced west with two wide quadrifores, four windows separated by pillars, simple Gothic windows on its side.
The closed wall mass, simplicity and the absence of carved details led experts to the conclusion that the facade was made in the 14th century.
However, it was built in the early 16th century.
During the centuries, the palace changed its purpose and owners.
The oldest coat of arms is the one of the Nadal family, who ruled it from 1400 until 1470.
Its purpose was changed in the 15th century; from the fortified defensive structure to the impressive residential building.
In the following century, the ownership of the castle was taken over by the Bembo family, who used it as the site for numerous social gatherings.

Although small, the palace of the Counts of Rigo is an exceptional achievement of the Baroque residential architecture.
Apart from the facade, the interior layout has been preserved.The Town Palace of the Rigo family in Novigrad is an exceptional example of Baroque residential architecture.
Although small in size, its formation makes it exceptionally representative.
The luxurious edifice was built in 1770.
Apart from the facade, the original inner layout has been preserved until the present day.
The central ground floor entrance leads into the antechamber and further onto the first floor.
Left and right from the entrance were, and still are, shops, among which is the Rigo Gallery of the Avant Garde Art.
The facade of the solid palace cube was disintegrated by harmonious decorative elements which cannot be seen on the Istrian palaces of the time.
Carved architectural elements have curved and soft lines, a characteristic of Late Baroque or Rococo.
The building is also the example of the Mid-European Baroque emerging along the Istrian coastline via Trieste.Velika ulica 5, HR-52466 Novigrad-CittanovaT:+385 (0)52 726 582<a href="mailto:muzej-museo.lapidarium@pu.t-com.hr" target="_blank">muzej-museo.lapidarium@pu.t-com.hr</a><a href="http://galerija-rigo.hr/" target="_blank">www.galerija-rigo.hr</a>

On the corner of Decumanus and Cardo in Poreč is the Zuccato Palace, today a gallery.
Although the Gothic palace has kept its original facade, the interior layout has not been preserved.
The Zuccato Palace is a three-storey building with the ground- and first floor built from stone, while the second was made of brick.
The latter was also embellished by architectural details made of stone such as its corner fortifications and, naturally, windows, thus standing out on the reddish brick.
The main facade opening on the Decumanus Street has Gothic double lancet windows with a trefoil floral finish, first in the row, while the other single lancet windows follow suit.
It is interesting to note that the first floor double lancet and the first single lancet window of the Cardo facade were made of stone from Korčula as visible in its colour, different from the rest.
They represent the only imported feature in Poreč of the time.
Unfortunately, the inner layout has not been preserved.

St. John of &Scaron;terna is a village near St. Lovreč and the former representative castle of the Polesini family.
The estate was given as dowry by the Scampicchio family in 1688 to the Gravisi family who later became Marquis Polesini.
The Venetian Apollonio family was also mentioned as one of St. John of &Scaron;terna's owners.
The noble Polesini family built a castle with the park and neighbouring buildings in the Palladian style on the hilltop near the village, the site of an earlier older castle.
It seems that the castle was built according to layouts designed by famous Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio himself.
It is probably the most beautiful Classicistic structure in Istria, a perfection of Classical architectural composition.
Recent research has found that the castle had probably obtained its final form in the 19th century.
The main residential building, which is at the same time the biggest structure of the entire complex, has a monumental Classicistic facade with a pronounced two-storey avant-corps and a four column porch accessed by a wide staircase.
A large central salon was put up in the ground floor entrance area.
The Polesinis moved the original staircase into their new villa on the St. Nicholas Island in front of Poreč in the late 19th century.
A spacious rectangular park surrounded by the wall was also an integral part of the castle.
Other structures used for economic purposes were placed within the walls.
There is also a Baroque stone cistern with exquisitely carved details and surrounded by a short wall in the yard.
A four-corner tower is a reminder of an older castle, which can still be recognized on the northern side of the castle.
The palace is inhabited, but very neglected.How to get there:Three kilometres north of Baderna, on the local road to Majkuse and Muntrilj, some 500 meters east from the Pula - Buje state road.Sveti Ivan od &Scaron;terne, HR-52463 Vi&scaron;njan-Visignano, Majkusi

How to get there:
The house with a picturesque name, the House of Two Saints, is an example of the profane Renaissance in Poreč.
The house ground floor is a semi-circular passage with two single lancet windows above and a semi-circular finish.
The facade is decorated by two reliefs depicting straight standing saints, after which the house was named.
Although they show characteristics of the 13th century Romanesque sculpture, the structure is a modest Renaissance building.
The House of Two Saints dates back to the end of the 15th or the early 16th centuries, while the facade sculptures had originally been a part of an older structure, most probably the St. Cassian Monastery, which archaeological remains were found nearby.
The building is used today as the Conservation Office.

Motovun is a medieval town with the best preserved town walls in Istria.
As the walls on its western side form two defensive structures, the town is entered by the twin gate.
The lapidarium with inscriptions and the relief from the Antiquity and the Middle Ages is located in the passage of the external town gates, while the inner ones have Early Gothic features.
A high tower was erected above the main town gates in the 16th century.
It gave the inhabitants of Motovun security, and made their enemies fear.
The tower is also known as The New Gate, the name which stems from the 17th century when it was renovated in 1607 during the rule of the Marco Pasqualagia podest&agrave;.
As the tower and the communal palace were joined, the tower had access to the citadel walls.

In the centre of Vižinada is a town square with a large cistern, one of the most important monuments of that type in Istria.
Finished in 1782, it was made from local limestone according to the design of Simone Battistella, the architect from Rovinj.
It is a flawless example of the Venetian Classicism.
The Vižinada cistern is rectangular, consisting of a stone parapet with columns on each of its four corners.
Its interior was divided by columns into three naves.
South and north entrances used to be closed up by a metal door.
Two stone wells were covered by metal lids decorated by Baroque iron arabesques.
The lion heads on the south facade of the cistern from both sides of a double staircase were used for eliminating water surplus.
The main square is dominated by the Church of St. Jerome, the one-nave Neo-Classicist structure erected between 1837 and 1840.
Not far from the church is a self-standing belfry, built most probably in the 16th century.
The square is encircled by the fontico, the town loggia, the Grimani and Facchinetti family houses, and the four-storey Maraston house, the tallest residential building of Vižinada.The square lost its urban characteristics after the municipal palace of the Grimani family was knocked down.
On the site of the palace, which stood to its south, a school, a kindergarten, a playground, and a gym have recently been built.
The only remaining trace of the former palace are the 16th century arches.
The building of the old fontico, a grain storehouse, has a large relief of a Venetian lion on its facade.
The new era contributed to the development of Vižinada, which became a crafts and trading centre of this part of west Istria.
The plate built into the lower part of the fontico facade proves its prosperity.
The 1726 pricelist for transporting individual Venetian products was carved into it.

The redecoration of the country estate in Dajla, started by the Grisoni family, resulted in the monumental U-shape Classicistic structure.The Grisoni family completely redecorated the facilities of the previous owner of this monumental country estate, the Savini family.
During the Middle Ages, it was the site of the Benedictine monastery.
At a later date, next to the country estate, the present-day settlement Dajla was developed.
The Grisonis renovated the estate radically by building the U-shaped three wing edifice with the central part and two wings.
The present-day two-storey building has a Classicistic braid in the centre, while the lateral wings are its symmetrical mirror image.
The court chapel was built in 1763.
It served as an inspiration for erecting its twin on the opposite wing to achieve symmetry.
The priest resided in the twin chapel.
The representative Classicistic palace of the Grisoni family was designed by French architect and adventurist Gabriel Le Terrier de Manetot in 1839.
He is responsible for its French Neoclassicistic appearance, unique in Istria.The palace was inhabited from the Antiquity, when it was the Roman villa.
During the centuries its long and turbulent history, it changed owners and its purpose.
Following the Roman phase, the villa was first inhabited by the Greek monks, then the Benedictines who owned it until the late 13th century when it was given as a gift to the Koper Savini family.
The Koper Counts Grisoni obtained the house in 1738 as the Savinis were without heirs.
In 1835, Franceso Grisoni vowed to the Benedictines after a personal tragedy, and the palace regained its monasterial function.
They owned it until 1948, when it was turned into the old people's home and the alms house until 1989.
Today, the complex is a dilapidated yet in its basic elements a well preserved architectural complex with a park once again owned by the church.Dajla, HR-52466 Novigrad-Cittanova

The windows of the Gothic structure on the south corner of the square have a typical pointed Gothic vault.
The structure facade was renovated in the 19th century, when the main entrance gable was also replaced.
The old gable was built in the house wall bearing a carved inscription in the Vodnjan dialect from 1448: ' Tali-me-domanda-come-sto-che-mai-co-teto-del-be-che-ho'.
It is a funny inscription by which the house owner is saying to the passers-by: thank you for asking, I am fine.

Grači&scaron;će, the small town or the urbanized village, was never a part of the Venetian Republic.
However, it was an integral part of the Pazin County, and as such a part of the Empire, which became the Monarchy at a later stage.
Despite it, Grači&scaron;će has one of the most beautiful examples of the Venetian architecture in Istria: the Salamon Palace.
Located next to the main gate, this harmonious two-storey building was constructed from the carefully chiselled local stone.

The Morosini-Grimani Castle is a medieval edifice with expressed Renaissance features.
It was named after the two families, its owners.Svetvinčenat was erected on the border which changed through history with the exchange of conquerors.
It was first mentioned in 983 in the document by Oton II as the property of the Bishop of Poreč.
Its ownership was first taken over by the Castropola family, and then by the Morosini family in 1384.
Pietro Morosini was last mentioned as the master of Svetvinčenat in 1529.
The new owners, the Grimani family, were being mentioned in the written documents since 1560.
The Grimanis renovated the castle after the fire.
Both families, the Morosinis and the Grimanis are the most significant in the history of the castle as well as of the entire village.
This is why the castle was named after them: Morosini-Grimani.

The Castle of Pazin is a well-defended fortress located on the edge of the Pazinčica river abyss.
It is also the biggest and the best preserved medieval fortress in Istria.
It was first mentioned in 983 in the deed of gift by Emperor Oton II, giving the castle to the Poreč Bishop as a present.
During next two hundred years, the castle often changed its owners.
It is known that the daughter of Menhard von Scharzenburg, its owner, married into the family of the Counts of Gorizia bringing it into their ownership until 1374 when it was taken over by the Habsburgs who continued to rule the entire area of central Istria i.e.
the Pazin County behind these powerful walls.
The power and strength of the castle was confirmed by it never being conquered in the war against Venice.
The inhabitants of Pazin had a lot of independence and freedom for that time, which had hugely differentiated them from most of their peasant neighbours.
In the 17th century, the castle was bought by Marquis Montecuccoli from Modena, who owned the feudal land until the mid 19th century.
The fortress stayed in their possession until 1945.

The Pazin Abyss or the abyss of the Pazinčica river, the longest Istrian subterranean river, is located in central Istria.
A well-known Pazin Castle was built above it.
Hydrogeologically, the pit is the abyss created at the border of a waterproof bed of the Pazinčica basin and waterproof limestone forming entire south-west Istria.
Pazinčica used to flow above the ground, passing Bermo and Dvigrad all the way to the coast and forming the Lim Bay.

Romuald's Cave is located on the east side of the Lim Channel.
It was named after St. Romuald.
The legend says that the hermit spent several years in the cave around the year 1000.
In his honour, religious procession were held until 1942.
They would start with the mass in the Church of St. Martin and finish at the cave entrance.
The establishment of the nearby Monastery of St. Michael the Archangel on Lim around 1040 is connected with the work of St. Romuald.
The cave is today protected as the karst phenomenon and the habitat of a large bat, endangered and legally protected species.
The cave had been formed 20000 years ago.
Some of its deposited sediments have large paleontological and paleoanthropological value.
Many animal remains were found, of which the most interesting are those of long extinct species such as the cave bear, lion, leopard or cave hyena.
Apart from extinct ice age animals, remains of the early man were also found as well as his artefacts such as awls, scrapers and alike.
A child's molar as the oldest trace of the early man was found in Istria.
The cave is 105 meters long.
The narrow and tall entrance leads to several bigger and more impressive halls.
A winding corridor widens at places and makes seven bigger rooms with exceptional decorations.
Its height varies between 5 and 7 meters, while its width is between two and seven.

The Lim Bay, known as the channel or the fjord, is located on the west coast of Istria, near Vrsar.
It is a sunken karst valley, almost 13 km long.
It is gradually getting more narrow from the entrance on.
The Lim Channel extends deeper into the interior of the Istrian peninsula creating the Lim Cove, extending almost to Pazin.
The total length of the Lim Bay and its land extension, the cove, is 35 km.
Since 1964, it has been a legally protected geomorphologic and hydrogeological site as important landscape.
In 1980, it was declared a special marine reserve.A particular feature of the Lim Bay is its brackish water resulting from the subterranean sweet water in the form of submarine karst spring emerging at the bay's end, making its salinity much lower.
A high concentration of oxygen creates specific features and enables a high bio production of planktons, fish and shellfish for breeding, especially mussels and oysters.
The bay coast is rather steep and high.
The northern side is covered by evergreen vegetation, and the southern by deciduous trees.
Northern coast verticals show four dark openings of larger semi-caves and caves, of which the most important is the Romuald's Cave.

The Motovun forest spreads along the Mirna River Valley, from the Istrian Spa to Livade and along the valley of the Botonega river.
Although no woody nor herbaceous species is indigenous to it, the forest of Motovun represents the last preserved type of lowland Mediterranean autochthonous forest of common oak, narrow-leafed ash and elm.
Such forests are known as longozas.
Only three have been preserved on the Mediterranean and the Ponta shore, of which one on the Istrian peninsula.
It was declared a special forest vegetation reserve in 1963, spreading across 275 hectares.
In the course of history, the forest was often being destroyed.
The Austro-Hungarian navy used its trees for building its ships.

The Brijuni Islands, located in the south of the western Istrian coast, has a total of 14 islands and islets, making it the best indented and largest group of islands on the Istrian area.
Together with the surrounding sea and underwater life, Brijuni was declared the national park in 1999 in light of its exceptional value.
The largest of the islands is Veliki Brijun.
Its coast as well as those of other islands are mainly short and rocky, although easily reachable.
Geologically and geomorphologically, Brijuni represent an extension of west Istria.
It is not surprising that 10000 years ago they were an integral part of the Istrian land.

The Basilica trail is a biking and hiking route, which 19 kilometres have been trying to increase the potential of the already existing Limes trail.
The entire length of the trail has a gastronomic and educational character as well.
There are 11 educational signs as well as 10 directional ones set up on the main trail points.
It stretches from Valalta or the Basilica valley, along the wide area of the Lim Channel, the Rovinj Village, intertwining with the former Kanfanar-Rovinj railroad.
The Basilica trail passes several important historical sites such as the churches of St. Bartholomew, St. Christopher, St. Thomas or St. Proto, as well as the abandoned Roman quarry.
There are four resting points established along the trail, in the vicinity of the Churches of St. Thomas, St. Christopher and St. Proto and at the Lim Channel viewpoint.
One part of the trail has been asphalted, while the other is macadam.
Landscapes with vineyards, olive groves and orchards, as well as protected natural beauties and rich vegetation stretching along the Lim Channel, make this trail particularly charming.

Due to its isolation, the village of Kotli has kept its rural 19th century look.
It also managed to preserve its mills that were in use till 1964.
The stone houses have many wooden elements, a material much used in the old architecture of northern Istria.
When compared to the surrounding area, these houses are more complex and lavish.
Thanks to the development of trades and crafts, life in Kotli was good.
Its inhabitants were known to be excellent players of the traditional musical instruments bajs, vijulina and klarinet.

Kažun, one room, dry stone and mostly round structure is one of the Istrian specificities.
Their greatest concentration is in the southern part of the Istrian peninsula.
There are more than 3000 huts in the vicinity of Vodnjan, and some in the northern and eastern parts.
Kažuni were traditionally used as shelters for farmers and shepherds in remote fields, and for storing tools.
They were erected in the areas where the stone had to be removed to obtain fertile land.
As a result, a lot of stone was left behind.
Its interesting feature are its dimensions and a particular construction method, a so-called dry stone building, a simple placing of stones on top of each other with no mutual bond.

The windmill, built 140 years ago is a symbol of Medulin and the keeper of its port.
Today it wears a new &ldquo;dress&rdquo; and grinds grain as it used to in ancient times, but with a little help from the electric motor on those days when the wind is not able to do so.The story of this malin (mill) began back in 1872 with the arrival of the Po&scaron;ić brothers from Rovinj to Medulin, where they decided to build two windmills along the coast.
Medulin&rsquo;s mills were the only ones of their type in the Mediterranean, so people came from all over, both by sea and land.
And so the lines of those waiting patiently to grind the grain that they had nurturingly cultivated soon formed in Medulin.The windmill built of stone has a circular ground plan, and was originally, just as it is today, covered with a shallow tapered roof.
It had eight sails that could be enlarged and reduced depending on the wind&rsquo;s force.Today&rsquo;s Medulin mill is a faithful copy of the previous one - the windmill with its torač (a room for grinding), the wooden elements of the mill, a rotating roof and eight-pointed propellers.
Inside, you will also find a variety of items for flour processing, as well as a number of antiques, which were left forgotten in the attics for years, and which are now shining the old shine in the rebuilt windmill.

Almost 160 years ago, Pula-Pola became the main war port of Austria and the Navy Observatory was established soon enough in 1869.
It was a part of the Royal Hydrographical Institute (K. und K. Hidrographisches Amt).
The building comprising of the observatory, repository of the nautical and physical instrument, repository of nautical maps and the navy library was built in 1871 at Monte Zaro, one of the hills in Pula.

Pula Observatory
In the early evening of 20 October 1995 it seemed that not much work would be accomplished in the observatory.
A fog rising from the sea covered the western coast of Istria all the way to Pula.
Fortunately, the central part of Istria, the plateau with Vi&scaron;njan on top, stuck out like an island emerging out of a sea of fog.
Part of the night was spent in replacing the telescope&rsquo;s damaged electronics, while the rest was spent on routine observation of the sky.
Around 11 pm the area around the star Kapa Arietis was filmed, and the location of the asteroid 4064 Marjorie, a huge rock formation 10 times the size of Učka, was calculated.
This small planet or asteroid orbits the Sun, right behind Mars.
It was discovered in 1960 at the famous Palomar Observatory in the USA.
The location of this specific asteroid had not been calculated for years, so the uncertainty of its precise location was growing.
It was required to take three shots and send them to the Small Solar-System Body Centre, along with calculations.

Owing to the low light-pollution of the sky over Istria, astronomy lovers can still enjoy observing the sky here.

This unusual, malodorous subterranean fungus of an unattractive form is &ndash; the truffle.
The rare and expensive tuber that grows in the fertile Istrian soil is the ultimate gastronomic delight.
The Istrian white truffle is one of the most highly prized in the world today.
Truffles
The truffle is the supreme delicacy that had been enjoyed by the Mesopotamian  rulers 4000 years ago, and it is still one of the most prestigious foodstuffs in  world gastronomy.
This intense flavour royal mushroom was known to the ancient  Greeks and the Roman emperors, and it was also served at the French court and  among the Austro-Hungarian aristocracy.
It is very rare and it grows only in  several locations in Europe - in some parts of France and Italy and in Istria,  favoured by mild climate, small temperature variations and grey clay soil.

Towns in the interior of Istria
If you wish to feel the atmosphere of good old country households, wholesome dishes of the traditional cuisine, romantic hearths and scented wine cellars, discover the charms of country tourism, small family-run rural hotels and homesteads.
Istria special - Countryside
In the first centuries of the early Middle Ages various barbarian tribes invaded Istria.
The invasion of the Avars and Lombards lasted for a brief period and they did not remain in Istria, but the Slavs spread throughout the peninsula and settled in many parts of its interior.
In 788 Istria became part of the Franconian state that introduced the feudal system, encouraged the settling of the Slavs, often on land owned by towns.
Thus, towns began to lose their autonomy (based upon classical legal norms) and their power declined, whereas at the same time the power of the Church increased, since the rule of Charlemagne depended on it.
Medieval towns
Romans in Istria
In the middle of the 2nd millennium BC, on the entire territory of Istria, fortification settlements began to appear on hilltops and prominent points above valleys.
More than 400 hill-forts have been recorded in Istria which speaks of the population density in the Bronze and Iron Ages.
They were mostly circular, ellipsoidal and surrounded by defensive walls.
Larger hill-forts were even encompassed by several rings of walls.
A special building technique was used where large stone blocks were laid without a bonding agent (dry wall).
Besides the quadrangular ground plan, houses were also circular and most probably had a roof made of stone slates like today&rsquo;s stone-huts (kažun) which then suggests that the same style of construction has survived from the Bronze Age until today.
Prehistoric settlements
The first traces of prehistoric people on the territory of Istria date back to the period of the Lower Palaeolithic.
The stone hand axe made by early man is about 2 million to 800,000 years old and was found in the vicinity of Pula, in &Scaron;andalja Cave.
Finds from the Upper Palaeolithic (40,000-10,000 BC) were found at the sites of &Scaron;andalja II and St. Romuald&rsquo;s Cave in Lim Bay.
Prehistoric people in Istria
Kažun is a small field hut that provided shelter, built using the dry wall technique - stone laid up without mortar.
Apart from offering shelter it was also used for checking fields and vineyards before the harvest.
Architectural heritage
People in Istria have always stone for their works of art, as well as everyday objects - slates for the construction of dry stone field huts kažuni, walls and covering roofs, and hard blocks of stone for dressing oils storage basins, decorative details on houses or crowns of wells.
Architectural heritage
Even today many people cherish memories of past times.
Vittorio Rossoni started his ethnographic collection completely by chance &ndash; while renovating his family house he came across some twenty old household articles that our grandparents used.
Architectural heritage
People who lived in these areas some hundred or more years ago cultivated land daily.
Very often they had to take it away from the stone, which they afterwards collected and used for enclosing their plots.
Architectural heritage
The characteristic old Istrian house - hiža is made of stone, with walls having pointed-up joints and roofs topped with half-round tiles.
Added to the front part of the facade is nearly always a baladur - staircase leading to the residential part of the house.
Architectural heritage
Fairs are the life-blood of every small town and in Istria they have kept to their traditions - every town has its own fair and a specific day on which it is held.
Tradition
Original Istrian souvenirs are items which, regardless of their simplicity, tell us much about Istria and its people.
They attract great attention as they are a perfect combination of traditional culture and modernity.
Tradition
Easter or locally known as Vazan is an important religious feast celebrating the resurrection of Jesus.
It is customary to wear something new on that day.
Since Easter is a holiday celebrating a new beginning and rebirth, which coincides with the beginning of spring, so people are symbolically revived through new clothing.
Tradition
Ethnographic museum of Istria preserves, and actively collects textile artefacts.
The main parts of the collection are Istrian traditional costumes.

The development of tourism as a social and economic phenomenon is related to the calming of the political situation in the first half of the 19th century after the Napoleonic wars, and to the modernization of transport equipment, primarily railroads, which facilitated long-distance travelling.
The expansion of tourism and its mass character allowed a creation of the famous rivieras, wintering-balneological and especially climatic health resorts and spas.Due to its favourable and healthy climate and interesting history, Istria has been attractive to the clientele from the continental parts of Europe ever since the beginning of modern tourism.
After 1844, when the Austrian Lloyd established permanent tourist line Trieste-Rijeka, ships regularly sailed to Piran, Novigrad, Poreč, Rovinj and Pula.
The construction of the railway line Divača-Pula with the branch line Kanfanar-Rovinj (1876) even more accelerated the development of Rovinj tourism, although then it was just about individual visits instead of organized arrivals.The year 1888 marks the official beginning of Rovinj tourism when the health resort Maria Theresia Seehospiz, provided for the treatment of poor children suffering from scrofulosis and rickets opened its doors.
This health resort was mostly visited by the children from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, but also from Germany, Russia and other countries.
The first meteorological measurements of air temperature started, as part of this health resort, which were compared with the Viennese values.In 1890 Knight Georg H&uuml;tterott, an entrepreneur from Trieste, enchanted by the Rovinj archipelago, bought four islands in its southern part (St. Andrew, Ma&scaron;kin, &Scaron;turag and St. John), and in the coming years started to buy private properties, south of the town in the area of Punta Corrente, Montauro, &Scaron;karabe, Monvi and Monte Mulini.
In the fenced area of almost 90 ha of pastures, vineyards and olive groves, he created a true nature park by afforestation of carefully selected Mediterranean and exotic plants.Since the purchase of the islands distinguished guests visited his property, as evidenced by the list in the memorial book Cissa Insel and the stone inscriptions along the trails on the island carved in the living limestone walls.
In the list of the memorial books until 1908 are mentioned Prince and Princess Coburg Gotha, Princess Stefanie von Habsburg, Archduke Ludwig Salvatore, Grand Duchess Maria Josef of Saxony, Princess Maria Theresa of Bavaria, Prince Hohenlohe with his family, Prince Johann Lichtenstein, and many other members of the European nobility; a number of admirals and officers of the Austro-Hungarian navy from Pula such as Maximilian von Sterneck, Hermann von Spaun, Rudolf Montecuccioli, Franz von Minutillo; entrepreneurs such as Arthur Krupp, Carl Escher, Paul Schoeller, E. Skoda; scientists such as R. Virchow, R. Burkhardt and others.
In 1910 the island was visited by the Crown Prince Francis Ferdinand, whose visit is described in a letter to a guard of the property.
Guests visited more often and stayed for longer periods of time on the island, and as a result the excursion tourism rapidly evolved into the stationary tourism.Due to the significant commercial success, the Emperor Franz Joseph in 1898 awarded Georg H&uuml;tterott the title of knight for his merits in the industry, and in 1905 he became a member of the Senate of the Imperial Council, by which the reputation of his family reached its peak.
As a young and successful merchant, due to his merits in 1879 he became the first Japanese consul in Europe.
As an admirer of space and the sea, Georg H&uuml;tterott owned yacht named Tornato, and in 1894 he purchased steam schooner, yacht "Suzume" (Japanese = sparrow), and together with the Archduke Charles Stephen became the forerunner of the sport sailing in this region.Overwhelmed with the ecstatic beauty of this area, and well aware of the remarkable success of some tourist resorts in the Adriatic, especially Opatija and Brioni, he began planning the creation of a real tourist destination.In a brochure issued in 1908, he exposed his idea of a building of climatic health resort modelled on similar facilities along the Istrian coast.
He founded a company with limited liability, which was supposed to take care of financing of the construction.
The project included the area of Monte Mulini, Montauro and Punta Corrente, where the trails, tree-lined avenues, meadows and parks were already constructed.
In addition, the property was surrounded by a two-meter stone wall, 900 m long, which stretched from the iron gate of the park to the sea on &Scaron;karaba.
He planned to build sports facilities, 3 hotels, and swimming area at the old beach Brunetti in the Lone bay.
The first hotel was envisaged on the last bend in the road that leads to the park, while the second was to be located in the park at the intersection of roads to Punta Corrente and Montauro.
The third, however, was supposed to be constructed at the Punta by the sea.
A number of villas were expected to follow the main road.About the feasibility of a such project testifies a bid for the purchase of a parcel of land worth a million crowns, which in that same year, i.e.
in 1908, Georg H&uuml;tterott immediately refused, and in 1918 for the purchase was even interested the Mayor of Vienna, Dr. Weisskirchner, in behalf of the City, driven exactly by a "little red book", as this project was named by Marie H&uuml;tterott.
And this offer, after several negotiations, was declined.The untimely death of Georg H&uuml;tterott in 1910 stopped most of the construction works, but the project stimulated thinking and gave impetus to the development of tourism in a true sense when in 1911 the Statute of the consortium of innkeepers, owners of coffee shops, liquor dealers and hoteliers (Consorzio dei trattori, osti caffetieri, liquoristi ed albergatori) was adopted.
By seeking help of the widow H&uuml;tterott in 1913 hotel "Adriatico" was opened and the foundations of a modern tourism were laid.
The Tourist Board of Rovinj-Rovigno published a new brochure entitled &lsquo;Cultural and historical itineraries of Rovinj&rsquo; which, among other things, presents eight routes that encompass all the cultural and historical sights of the town with an emphasis on the old town, its surroundings and the wider urban surroundings.
Each route is described and accompanied by a corresponding graphic display on the map.
The first part of the brochure entitled &lsquo;Itineraries through the former island village&rsquo; presents four possible routes with attractions located in the old town, the second part titled &lsquo;Itinerary on the other side of the former channel&rsquo; suggests a route through the old part of the town opposite the old town centre, and the third section entitled &lsquo;Historical and cultural heritage of the immediate and wider surroundings of Rovinj&rsquo; presents two routes passing the sights in the northern part of the town, which covers the area to the Lim Channel and the south-east area, which covers the area to the ornithological reserve Palud.
The fourth chapter of the brochure, &lsquo;Rovinj islands&rsquo;, presents the islands of Rovinj.The author is a historian, Marino Budicin, who suggested all the described routes.
All the sights from the itineraries contain a short description and important information, and each itinerary includes a list of numerous attractions that reflect the rich history, culture and tradition of Rovinj.
This brochure, intended for all those who, through the proposed itinerary, want to discover a part of Rovinj's rich cultural, historical and traditional heritage, is available from the Tourist Board office in Croatian, Italian, German and English.

Life in Rovinj has always been inextricably linked to the sea.
The town&rsquo;s centuries-old fishing tradition has been preserved until today, as the harmony between the citizens living in the old town and the coastal Adriatic landscape became symbolized by the batana.
The batana is a wooden flatboat of 4-6 meters in length and the commonest type of vessel in Rovinj.
This boat is regarded as a tangible embodiment of the customs, traditions, language, habits, mentality and spiritual atmosphere of Rovinj and its citizens.
During the summer months, visitors to Rovinj, as well as local residents, can witness the construction of the batana taking place in the town centre, on the plateau in front of the Batana House Eco Museum.
There, a Rovinj kalafat (ship builder) builds a batana in the evening, and later in the summer you can also witness the boat&rsquo;s launch.
Moreover, several times a week visitors can enjoy a boat ride in a batana as a part of the &ldquo;Batana with Fishing Light Parade and a Dinner at the Spacio&rdquo; event.
The parade begins with a visit to the Batana House Eco Museum, followed by a ride in a batana around the old town.
The event ends with a dinner and a performance of bitinada songs at a traditional Rovinj tavern &ndash; Spacio Matika.
The tradition of building batana boats is inseparable from the musical tradition of Rovinj, namely bitinada songs, Rovinj folk songs representing an authentic musical expression.
According to tradition, bitinada songs came to be as Rovinj fishermen, whose hands were occupied for hours while fishing on boats or repairing nets, thought of a way to achieve top-quality orchestral performances using their own voices instead of instruments.
This is an original way of accompanying the lead singer which involves imitating musical instruments used in any song the lead singer wishes to perform.
When a soloist (or soloists performing as a duo) starts singing a song, the bitinad&ugrave;rs (that is how fifteen or more members forming the group are called) use all their skills to imitate the sounds of instruments in a hypothetical orchestra.
Usually, each performance is unique because it is improvised.
The Batana House Eco Museum, devoted to the wooden boat, is listed in UNESCO's Register of the world&rsquo;s best practices for the safeguarding of intangible cultural heritage.
Several times a week, visitors can attend the batana parade taking place in the evening.
A batana is a traditional Rovinj flatboat sometimes equipped with a fishing lantern.
The parade starts at the small pier near the main town square, and it will take you around the beautiful old town to the spacio Matika in Vladimir &Scaron;valba Street, which can also be accessed by boat.
During the boat parade, visitors will be able to enjoy the melodies sung by folk bands, such as &ldquo;Batana&rdquo; or &ldquo;Bitinadora&rdquo;, of the &ldquo;Marco Garbin&rdquo; cultural and artistic association, while at the spacio a traditional dinner consisting of fish dishes will be served.
This is a place where residents of Rovinj not only kept, tasted and sold wine in their stone-built houses, but also socialised, dined, played briscola and tressette, sang and had fun.
Such a well-preserved spacio became an integral part of the Batana House Eco Museum in 2006, since when it has served a venue where musical, gastronomic and other types of events have been organized by members of the museum.
At the spacio, visitors can enjoy the finest selections of agricultural products and seafood: wine made from local varieties of Malvasia and Teran grapes, homemade olive oil, as well as fish and shellfish caught by local fishermen.
A performance of bitinada songs (typical Rovinj fishermen songs), given by superb singers called bitinad&ugrave;rs from the &ldquo;Marco Garbin&rdquo; cultural and artistic association or the &ldquo;Batana&rdquo; folk band, adds the finishing touch to the flavours and scent of batana cuisine.
A visit to the spacio is a unique opportunity to get acquainted with Rovinj's maritime culture!
Rovinj folklore is represented by the Stjepan Žiža (Rovinjsko Selo) and Plesarin cultural and artistic associations, which maintain and preserve the traditional Istrian heritage and customs (costumes, music, songs, dialects).
Their performances aim to popularize the original cultural heritage, including dances, vocal and instrumental music and other types of customs.
In summer, these cultural and artistic associations often perform in the town centre and thus offer a display of customary lore to both locals and guests.
Rovinj cuisine is based on seafood which used to be caught by locals who set out to the open sea in batanas.
In order to preserve the tradition of typical Rovinj cookery, the Batana House Eco Museum published The Traditional Rovinj Cuisine Cookbook.
This thirty-page book contains fifteen traditional recipes, ranging from recipes for appetizers to main course recipes.
All the recipes carry their original names in Rovinj dialect and include a local proverb.
Moreover, next to each basic ingredient there is a description on when and how it is caught.
The cookbook contains recipes for fried sea anemones, brodet (a type of fish stew), fried picarels with kale and so on.
Experience Rovinj like a local - with a batana boat ride into the sunset!
Just as the golden hour begins, your &ldquo;barcaiolo&ldquo; will take you on a romantic cruise around the Rovinj archipelago.
Enjoy stunning sunset views, taste traditional homemade Rovinj Pelinkovac and enjoy a gourmet dinner at La Puntulina!

Delfin je olimpijski bazen, dimenzija 50x22x2 metara.
Smje&scaron;ten je u blizini hotela Park.
Na bazenu se nalaze sanitarni čvorovi, tu&scaron;evi, sunčali&scaron;te i kafić.
Koriste ga plivački i vaterpolo klubovi za treninge, ali i građani i gosti svakodnevno za kupanje.
Rovinj's beaches include areas where dogs are allowed to swim, such as: Borik beach - from the northern wall of the Rovinj hospital; the quarry in the &lsquo;Zlatni rt&rsquo;, Golden Cape Forest Park - before the ascent from the north and south side; &Scaron;karaba beach - in the cove on the west side; Cuvi cove in the western part towards the &Scaron;karaba beach, and after the beach bar towards the tourist resort 'Villas Rubin'; Bolničko naselje - on the beach across the Luigi Monti Street; Kastelan cove &ndash; towards the tourist resort 'Amarin'; Ve&scaron;tar cove - at the end of the white trail after the Mon Paradis campsite; Cistern cove &ndash; next to the cistern.
These natural landscapes belong to the category of 'landscapes of outstanding value'.
One should not be surprised to learn this, as the indented coast, holm oak, Alpine and Bruce pine forests and the special agricultural spaces amaze and capture by their beauty and level of preservation.
This 'landscape of outstanding value' stretches from St. John's Cape (Rt Sv.
Ivana) to Barbariga and encompasses all twenty or so Rovinj islands and islets and the coastal area up to the distance of 500 m from the coastline.
The St Andrew Island (Otok Sv.
Andrija), occupying an area of 23 hectares, is the largest island of the Rovij archipelago, followed by the beautiful St. Catherine's Island (Otok Sv.
Katarine), a true rarity in terms of vegetation.
Botanists have recorded as many as 456 plant species there.
It is a protected landscape with slopes that are covered in different forms of evergreen shrubs and oak medunac and bitter oak.
This flora diversity on a relatively narrow area represents a unique phenomena and a special ecological value.
Romuald's Cave is located nearby and can be reached by climbing through the 360 meter-long woods.
The length of the cave is 105 meters.
The average temperature in its interior is around 12 degrees and relative humidity is 70-75 per cent.
The oldest remnants of the early man in Istria were found in this cave.
Along with the cave bear, cave lion, leopard, wolf, fox, brown bear, cave hyena, snow rabbit...a total of 41 animal species were found in the cave.
IThe brackish swamp in the south of the Rovinj region spreads over 219 ha, and has fascinating flora, including several rare botanical species.
The whole region is rich in fauna and flora, especially ornithofauna and water birds during the nesting, wintering and migration periods.
Until now 220 bird species have been recorded.
The area was designated an ornithological reserve in 2001.
The quarry is located 1.5 km from Rovinj in the Monfiorenzo (toponym) area along the Rovinj-Bale road, and is a unique example of limestone sedimentation in the world.
Vertical and horizontal cross sections show layers of genetically different types of dolomite with preserved texture and digenetic and genetic characteristics.
The rocks in this quarry are older than 130 million years and are used to provide a scientific explanation of similar rocks elsewhere.
Among the most beautiful landscapes of western Istria is most assuredly the park &lsquo;Zlatni rt&rsquo; which protects Rovinj and its harbour from the south, and extends along the picturesque bays Lone and &Scaron;karaba, and Montauro and Punta Corrente capes.
In 1890 the Trieste entrepreneur Georg H&uuml;tterott (Trieste, 1852 &ndash; 1910) bought plots in the bays Lone, and on Montravo and Punta Corrente capes, thus starting the slow transformation of that part of the landscape into a beautiful forest park.
Georg H&uuml;tterott began the process of afforestation, which resulted in a forest rich in botanical species, as well as many tree-lined paths, promenades, trails and meadows.
Pine trees, cypresses and laurel trees are the most common tree types in the park.
Many exotic plants (such as the Lebanese cedar, Douglas fir, Ginkgo biloba, eucalyptus, etc.)
were given to Georg H&uuml;tterott as a gift, or were brought by him from his travels.
In front of the Punta Corrente Meadow tall and beautiful Himalayan cedars are arranged in a six-pointed star.
H&uuml;tterott must have had in his mind the uniqueness of parks of his time, especially the English landscape parks, when he planted the trees in this singular figure.
Furthermore, according to the brochure Klimatischer Kurort Cap Aureo bei Rovigno &ndash; Istrien.
Ein Projekt published in 1908, H&uuml;tterott intended to transform &lsquo;Cap Aureo&rsquo; and what he called the &lsquo;coast of the sun&rsquo; into a health resort which was supposed to become one of the most important tourism destinations in this part of the world.
Years of care, even after his death in 1910, have transformed this area into a unique and rich natural arboretum.
It was designated a protected area in 1948, and a forest park in 1961, and still has that status today.
Saline is located right next to the Valalta area &ndash; this is a sort of a lagoon, muddy grounds with particularly interesting flora, where numerous and diverse birds stop by.
It is well-known for its quality, special, bitter taste and strong smell of wormwood.
It is made according to traditional recipes passed down from the first owner of the liquor factory Giorgio Benussi, since 1925 until today, when it is produced by the factory Darna d.o.o., testifying to the traditionalism that is also inherent to the modern times.It is produced from the essence of the Artemisia herb, commonly known as wormwood or pelin in Croatian.
The natural color is obtained from caramelization of sugar in special copper kettles.
It matures in oak barrels, which gives it a special flavor, aroma and distinctive quality.
Rovinjski pelinkovac is served as an aperitif, it is an excellent digestive, and can be consumed chilled, straight or mixed with soft drinks.
It contains 28% alcohol.
The batana is the most widespread traditional vessel in Rovinj, reflecting the continuity of the local tangible and intangible maritime and fishing heritage, as well as the ongoing strands in the local people's everyday lives.The batana is a flat bottom wooden fishing vessel slightly curved towards the bow and stern.
Model ship of Rovinj&rsquo;s batane is a handmade wooden souvenir of size dimensions 35x15x42 cm.
Boat is made of wood and her sail of canvas.
Recipes of the Batana House have been passed down through the generations and prepared both at home and in the special atmosphere of Rovinj's tavern - spacio, but also during family and group excursions.
These specialties are mostly made of simple ingredients and they are quite &ldquo;easy&rdquo; to prepare.
Recipes have kept their traditional ingredients and they capture the true essence and flavours of fish, crabs and seafood, main gastronomic specialties of Rovinj.
The living circumstances in Rovinj have greatly affected the origin of dishes from the selection of the author of the Recipe book.
These circumstances are related primarily to the maritime market, rich in fish, and modest social standard of fishermen, sailors and farmers which did not allow culinary licentiousness of the local cuisine, but set unsurpassed standards of natural food flavours.
Local cuisine recipes use little spices and seasonings but carefully selected to bring out the underlying flavor of fish.
These are salt, pepper, vinegar, onion and garlic, bay leaf, parsley, polenta, kale, chicory and various salads.
The gastronomic specialties of Batana Hause are accompanied by wine and olive oil, two major agricultural produce of Istria and Rovinj, and this is considered to be an authentic culinary ritual.
To fully experience Istria you should also sail out &ndash; not only to see the most beautiful parts from the open sea, but also to feel the primordial connection between the people and the sea.

The Lim Channel is the protected landscape whose sides are covered with different types of thick Mediterranean underbrush, the Downy Oak and the Turkey oak.
This kind of vegetation variety on a relatively small area represents a unique phenomenon and a special ecological value.

The tradition of the Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Hospital &ldquo;Prim.
Dr. Martin Horvat&rdquo; goes back to the Austro-Hungarian period.
Owing to the beneficial Mediterranean climate and its location on the peninsula of St Pelagius, the hospital had been an attractive coastal health resort for the treatment of bone diseases of the then European aristocracy right from its founding.
The hospital complex was built under the patronage of Maria Theresa and inaugurated in her presence on 22 May 1888.
The hospital&rsquo;s opening was supported by Vienna-based doctors, particularly by prof. Luigi Monti, the first hospital director.
The hospital&rsquo;s reputation as a health resort, as well as an ideal place for spending a holiday and undergoing orthopaedic rehabilitation, lasted for a century, and it ensured the loyalty of Austrian patients who gladly used the hospital services, mainly under long-term contracts with the AUVA Austrian insurance company.
The Department of Surgery was active until the 1990s.
Today, hospital treatment is based on physical medicine and rehabilitation with patients staying on either full or half board.
Treatment in the hospital encompasses various types of physical therapy and rehabilitation, i.e.
kinesiotherapy, hydrotherapy and electrotherapy in combination with beneficial properties of the surrounding nature (helio- and thalassotherapy).
The first therapeutic beach suitable for persons with health difficulties was opened in June 2017.

                  Giovannija Olinija te dijelovi tijela sv.
Sebastijana i sv.
Barbare.
Zbirka s mumijama  u vodnjansku je crkvu dospjela prije
                  180 godina.
Bježeći pred ratnom opasno&scaron;ću donio ju je iz Italije Gaetano Gresler.
Odgovora na pitanje - kako su se
                  tijela koja nisu balzamirana očuvala do danas (najstarije datira s kraja 12. stoljeća) - za sada jo&scaron; nema.
Iznimno očuvana priroda, biolo&scaron;ka raznolikost,  njegovani pejzažni parkovi razlozi su zbog čega će vam domaćini
                  preporučiti izlet na djevičansko otočje Brijuni.
No, to nije sve.
Ono ima i svoju zanimljivu priču od antike do dana&scaron;njih
                  dana.
Na Brijunima se odmarao i car Franjo Josip i engleska kraljica, ali i  brojni državnici u novije doba.
Posljednjih su
                  godina Brijuni ugostili i Maria del Monaca, Naomi Campbell, Placida Dominga i niz drugih slavnih ličnosti.
Obiđete li Veliki Brijun turističkim vlakom uvjerit ćete se  da su stari Rimljani znali &scaron;to je užitak.
U pitomoj
                  uvali Verige vidljivi su ostaci vile rustice iz prvog stoljeća.
Nakon &scaron;to je Paul  Kupelwieser koncem 19. stoljeća
                  uredio lječili&scaron;ta i hotele, otočje je privuklo europsku elitu.
Zanimljivo je i razdoblje od 1954. do 1979. godine kada
                  su kao gosti Josipa Broza Tita Brijune pohodili nebrojeni državnici i poznate ličnosti.
O njihovom boravku na otočju svjedoči
                  stalni postav fotografija.
U istoj je zgradi i izložba prepariranih životinja koje su mahom donosili državnici iz zemalja
                  diljem svijeta.
Dio je izletničkog programa i obilazak safari parka gdje pasu jeleni lopatari, mufloni, aksisi, a kraj njih
                  obitavaju zebre, somalijske ovce, indijska goveda, jednogrba deva, lame i slonovi.
Dio je izletničkog programa i posjet arheolo&scaron;kom muzeju otoka u mletačkom ka&scaron;telu te obilazak male gotičke
                  crkve Sv.
Germana iz 15. stoljeća gdje je postavljena izložba kopija istarskih fresaka i glagolja&scaron;kih spomenika Istre.
Brijunska se skupina sastoji od 14 otoka ukupne povr&scaron;ine 7,4 kilometara četvornih, s dužinom obale od čak gotovo
                  47 kilometara.
Obala je mahom kamenita, niska i pristupačna.
Na četverosatni izlet kreće se brodom iz Fažane.
Osim na Veliki Brijun moguć je i organizirani posjet uz kupanje na Mali
                  Brijun.
Želite li ku&scaron;ati najkvalitetnija istarska vina, preporučamo obilazak vinskih staza Buj&scaron;tine.
Na infopunktovima
                  možete nabaviti karte vinskih staza pojedinih dijelova Istre.
Krećete li sami u istraživanje posjetite istarske gradiće sredi&scaron;nje
                  i sjeverne Istre na brežuljcima.
Sigurno će vas osvojiti Motovun, Oprtalj, Hum kao najmanji grad na svijetu, glagolja&scaron;ki
                  Roč, zatim Grači&scaron;će, Pićan, Boljun i mnogi drugi.

Cave Romane, stari rimski vinkuranski kamenolom iz kojeg se jo&scaron; u 1. stoljeću vadio kamen za gradnju pulske Arene,
                  jedinstvena je pozornica za koncerte klasične glazbe.
Jedinstven je i prostor, fantastično akustičan, pa operne arije koje su posljednjih ljeta pjevali renomirani glazbenici
                  i svirala filharmonija zvuče gotovo nestvarno.
Oko tisuću mjesta u savr&scaron;enom skladu s prirodom čini doživljaj glazbe
                  naprosto čudesnim.
Kamenolom je uređen, a zaputite li se na koncert svakako prije njegovog početka pro&scaron;ećite labirintom
                  kamenih blokova na njegovom ulasku.
